Then
it
crossed
my
mind
that
there
could
have
been
an
accident
.
And
the
right-hand
door
was
open
,
that
seemed
a
bit
odd
.
So
I
drew
into
the
side
and
went
to
take
a
look
.
There
was
no
one
about
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
I
walked
into
the
trees
.
A
kind
of
instinct
I
suppose
.
It
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
and
I
wondered
whether
to
call
out
.
Then
I
felt
a
fool
and
decided
to
leave
it
and
mind
my
own
business
.
And
it
was
then
that
I
almost
tripped
over
her
.
"
He
took
another
gulp
of
the
wine
.
"
I
still
could
n't
see
anything
,
of
course
,
but
I
knelt
down
and
groped
about
with
my
hands
.
And
it
was
then
that
I
touched
flesh
.
I
think
I
touched
her
thigh
,
I
ca
n't
be
sure
.
But
flesh
,
even
dead
flesh
,
is
unmistakable
.
So
I
went
back
to
the
car
and
got
my
torch
.
I
shone
it
on
her
feet
and
then
slowly
up
her
body
to
her
face
.
And
then
,
of
course
,
I
saw
.
I
knew
it
was
the
Whistler
.
"
Meg
Dennison
asked
gently
:
"
Was
it
very
terrible
?
"
He
must
have
heard
in
her
voice
what
she
obviously
felt
,
not
prurience
but
sympathy
,
an
understanding
that
he
needed
to
talk
.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
if
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
then
paused
,
giving
the
question
serious
thought
.
"
More
shocking
than
terrible
.
Looking
back
my
emotions
were
complicated
,
a
mixture
of
horror
,
disbelief
and
,
well
,
shame
.
I
felt
like
a
voyeur
.
The
dead
,
after
all
,
are
at
such
a
disadvantage
.
She
looked
grotesque
,
a
little
ridiculous
,
with
thin
clumps
of
hair
sticking
out
of
her
mouth
as
if
she
was
munching
.
Horrible
,
of
course
,
but
silly
at
the
same
time
.
I
had
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
giggle
.
I
know
it
was
only
a
reaction
to
shock
but
it
was
hardly
admirable
.
And
the
whole
scene
was
so
,
well
,
banal
.
If
you
had
asked
me
to
describe
one
of
the
Whistler
's
victims
that
's
exactly
how
I
should
have
seen
her
.
You
expect
reality
to
be
different
from
imaginings
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
Perhaps
because
the
imaginings
are
usually
worse
.
"
Meg
Dennison
said
gently
:
"
You
must
have
been
terrified
.
I
know
I
should
have
been
.
Alone
and
in
darkness
with
such
horror
.
"
He
shifted
his
body
towards
her
and
spoke
as
if
it
were
important
that
she
,
of
all
those
present
,
should
understand
.
"
No
,
not
terrified
,
that
was
the
surprising
part
.
I
was
frightened
,
of
course
,
but
only
for
a
second
or
two
.
After
all
,
I
did
n't
imagine
he
'd
wait
around
.
He
'd
had
his
kicks
.
He
is
n't
interested
in
men
anyway
.
I
found
myself
thinking
the
ordinary
,
commonplace
thoughts
.
I
must
n't
touch
anything
.
I
must
n't
destroy
the
evidence
.
I
've
got
to
get
the
police
.
Then
,
walking
back
to
the
car
,
I
started
rehearsing
what
I
'd
say
to
them
,
almost
as
if
I
were
concocting
my
story
.
I
tried
to
explain
why
it
was
that
I
went
into
the
bushes
,
tried
to
make
it
sound
reasonable
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
What
was
there
to
justify
?
You
did
what
you
did
.
It
sounds
reasonable
enough
to
me
.
The
car
was
a
danger
slewed
across
the
road
.
It
would
have
been
irresponsible
just
to
drive
on
.
"
"
It
seemed
to
need
a
lot
of
explaining
,
then
and
later
.
Perhaps
because
all
the
subsequent
police
sentences
began
with
"
why'
"
.
You
get
morbidly
sensitive
to
your
own
motives
.
It
's
almost
as
if
you
have
to
convince
yourself
that
you
did
n't
do
it
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
impatiently
:
"
But
the
body
,
when
you
first
went
back
for
the
torch
and
saw
her
,
you
were
certain
she
was
dead
?
"
"
Oh
yes
,
I
knew
she
was
dead
.
"
"
How
could
you
have
known
?
It
could
have
been
very
recent
.
Why
did
n't
you
at
least
try
to
resuscitate
her
,
give
her
the
kiss
of
life
?
It
would
have
been
worth
overcoming
your
natural
repugnance
.
"
Dalgliesh
heard
Meg
Dennison
make
a
small
sound
between
a
gasp
and
a
groan
.
Lessingham
looked
at
Hilary
and
said
coolly
:
"
It
would
have
been
if
there
had
