Mark
picked
up
another
car
at
the
London
plant
and
drove
up
the
M1
to
his
home
in
north
Buckinghamshire
.
Turning
off
the
motorway
at
the
service
station
he
entered
a
different
world
.
Driving
very
slowly
over
the
narrow
bridges
spanning
the
fast
flowing
streams
which
stemmed
from
the
River
Ouse
,
he
noticed
that
a
massive
flock
of
coots
had
flown
in
while
he
had
been
away
.
There
must
have
been
two
or
three
thousand
on
the
river
banks
and
the
water
.
Pulling
the
car
off
the
narrow
country
lane
,
Mark
pressed
the
button
which
activated
the
power-operated
windows
.
It
was
early
evening
and
very
still
.
Soft
white
clouds
remained
motionless
against
an
azure
blue
sky
.
Between
the
many
breaks
in
the
cloud
the
rays
of
a
thin
evening
sun
shafted
down
at
an
acute
angle
to
spotlight
the
pastoral
scene
.
Away
to
the
west
a
flock
of
Canada
geese
was
heading
home
to
descend
on
one
of
the
larger
lakes
in
the
distance
.
In
the
foreground
another
smaller
flock
was
taking
off
from
the
little
lake
on
the
south
side
.
Squawking
madly
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
family
squabble
over
the
direction
they
should
take
,
they
suddenly
closed
ranks
,
as
if
by
order
,
and
formed
a
perfect
vee
behind
their
leader
.
They
then
wheeled
in
unison
into
a
shaft
of
light
which
held
them
for
a
second
or
so
before
they
soared
over
the
car
and
away
.
Standing
in
shallow
water
amongst
the
tall
reeds
on
the
banks
of
the
river
,
Mark
counted
eight
herons
,
all
motionless
,
their
necks
inclined
upwards
at
precisely
the
same
angle
,
as
if
in
silent
prayer
.
On
the
river
banks
to
the
east
,
mallard
and
teal
were
pecking
away
at
their
undercarriages
and
,
in
the
meadow
flanking
the
lane
,
two
hares
were
squaring
up
.
High
overhead
,
barely
visible
or
audible
,
a
jumbo
jet
began
its
gentle
descent
to
Heathrow
.
Mark
looked
up
at
the
tiny
speck
in
the
stratosphere
and
imagined
he
could
hear
the
air
hostess
requesting
passengers
to
fasten
their
seat
belts
.
He
looked
again
at
the
beautifully
unspoiled
Buckinghamshire
countryside
.
It
was
great
to
be
home
again
.
He
drove
leisurely
up
the
country
lane
and
ascended
the
hill
,
before
bearing
left
along
the
escarpment
.
Away
in
the
distance
,
tucked
between
a
fold
in
the
surrounding
hills
,
was
home
.
Mark
always
experienced
the
same
feelings
of
contentment
when
entering
the
home
straight
.
Today
he
felt
particularly
pleased
to
be
back
.
Gently
nosing
the
car
down
the
hill
into
the
village
,
he
turned
off
the
road
into
the
gravelled
drive
which
led
to
the
eighteenth-century
stone
barn
.
Hearing
the
wheels
of
the
car
on
the
gravel
the
two
young
golden
retriever
bitches
,
Honey
and
the
pick
of
the
litter
,
Harriet
,
bounded
through
the
hall
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
intruder
from
the
dining-room
window
.
Standing
on
their
hind
legs
with
front
paws
resting
on
the
deep
window
sills
,
they
saw
Mark
getting
out
of
his
car
and
went
berserk
.
Racing
back
into
the
hall
with
tails
wagging
furiously
,
they
almost
knocked
Georgina
over
.
She
had
also
heard
a
car
come
up
the
drive
,
and
was
heading
through
the
hall
to
the
porch
.
She
opened
the
heavy
oak
doors
and
the
dogs
swept
past
her
bounding
across
the
drive
to
their
master
who
was
opening
up
the
car
boot
to
remove
his
luggage
.
Mark
turned
,
just
as
the
dogs
took
off
together
in
a
huge
leap
which
struck
him
in
the
chest
,
knocking
him
backwards
into
the
boot
where
he
sat
,
legs
dangling
,
with
both
arms
wrapped
around
the
excited
dogs
.
Looking
up
,
he
saw
Georgina
standing
at
the
open
door
with
a
welcoming
smile
.
"
Hello
,
darling
,
"
he
called
waving
with
his
right
hand
while
trying
to
keep
the
dogs
at
bay
with
his
left
.
"
Welcome
home
,
sweetheart
!
"
She
flung
her
arms
around
him
.
"
Such
a
long
time
!
"
she
gasped
in
his
ear
as
they
hugged
each
other
tightly
,
the
dogs
retiring
a
respectful
distance
to
sit
and
watch
the
homecoming
with
tails
swishing
excitedly
over
the
gravel
.
"
I
've
missed
you
so
much
,
this
time
,
"
she
told
him
breathlessly
.
"
Ca
n't
think
why
.
Really
forgotten
what
you
look
like
.
Let's
have
a
look
at
you
.
Hum
,
not
bad
,
considering
your
age
and
everything
I
suppose
-
.
"
"
It
s
great
to
be
home
,
darling
.
I
've
missed
you
too
,
"
he
whispered
in
her
ear
.
"
Do
n't
know
why
I
feel
this
way
.
Must
be
Spring
!
"
During
Mark
's
absence
in
Spain
,
"
the
mole
"
Fred
Klepner
had
spent
countless
hours
going
over
the
Ten
Year
Business
plan
which
was
to
be
the
subject
of
the
presentation
Mark
was
to
give
to
Nate
Cocello
at
the
next
Planning
Committee
meeting
.
Klepner
had
studied
the
plan
with
a
sense
of
shock
.
He
had
arrived
in
Europe
knowing
nothing
about
the
European
motor
industry
or
the
Continent
's
political
and
economic
environment
,
except
from
what
he
had
read
on
the
subject
at
Harvard
Business
School
and
in
Detroit
Central
Office
reports
.
He
had
been
under
the
erroneous
impression
that
Europe
was
just
one
big
common
market
,
similar
in
size
to
the
United
States
,
operating
under
free
trade
concepts
,
and
with
common
laws
,
rules
and
regulations
.
He
had
therefore
assumed
that
the
preparation
of
a
European
plan
would
be
broadly
similar
to
the
planning
practices
normally
followed
in
the
United
States
.
In
consequence
,
he
had
read
the
two
hundred
page
European
Plan
with
open-mouthed
incredulity
.
It
was
a
totally
different
planning
world
from
the
United
States
.
The
plan
was
also
prepared
in
a
different
way
from
those
drafted
by
the
US
divisions
,
as
it
had
to
be
to
give
proper
consideration
to
the
problems
and
needs
of
a
totally
different
planning
environment
.
For
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
Harvard
Business
School
of
Management
Klepner
now
began
to
have
a
glimmer
of
understanding
of
the
many
important
practical
differences
between
Europe
and
the
United
States
.
The
first
section
of
the
plan
developed
all
the
major
assumptions
upon
which
it
was
based
.
These
assumptions
detailed
the
principal
factors
under
separate
headings
,
such
as
Political
,
Economic
,
Technical
,
Commercial
,
Environmental
,
Energy
and
so
on
.
These
headings
were
then
broken
down
to
test
the
assumptions
by
critical
analysis
,
country
by
country
identifying
the
common
European
factors
and
the
variables
.
In
developing
the
short
list
of
manufacturing
locations
he
proposed
to
establish
to
produce
the
new
products
which
would
incorporate
all
the
latest
technologies
,
he
had
detailed
the
comparative
costs
of
manufacture
per
country
and
identified
the
economic
and
commercial
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
selling
components
into
specific
European
countries
from
single
and
dual
manufacturing
sources
.
It
was
patently
obvious
to
Klepner
,
now
that
he
had
read
the
plan
,
that
the
European
trade
environment
was
not
as
he
had
been
led
to
believe
.
He
spent
the
entire
first
week
reading
the
plan
over
and
over
again
.
Two
days
before
Mark
returned
to
England
,
Klepner
spent
a
whole
day
with
Muldoon
going
over
the
plan
.
The
upshot
of
this
meeting
was
that
Muldoon
phoned
Mueller
and
Klepner
was
on
the
next
plane
to
Detroit
with
photostat
copies
of
Mark
's
plan
,
for
Mueller
's
eyes
only
.
Mark
arrived
at
his
office
expecting
to
have
a
few
clear
days
ahead
to
finalise
the
European
Business
Plan
and
prepare
his
presentation
to
Cocello
.
But
it
did
n't
happen
that
way
.
He
received
an
internal
phone
call
from
Muldoon
,
who
told
him
that
McGillicuddy
wanted
him
to
go
on
to
Dublin
immediately
.
The
Irish
Prime
Minister
had
evidently
made
a
personal
approach
to
his
compatriot
,
the
Chairman
of
United
Motors
,
Tom
O'Reilly
,
pleading
for
more
American
investment
to
help
the
"
auld
counthrie
"
.
The
Irish
never
allowed
their
expatriates
to
forget
the
debt
they
owed
the
Emerald
Isle
.
United
Motors
had
already
built
a
component
plant
in
Dublin
a
few
years
before
,
at
the
specific
request
of
the
Chairman
,
but
it
had
never
operated
profitably
.
It
had
been
plagued
by
excessive
absenteeism
,
restrictive
practices
,
inter-union
demarcation
lines
and
poor
product
quality
.
Mark
's
quarterly
reports
which
highlighted
the
plant
problems
were
not
well
received
by
the
Chairman
-
according
to
his
personal
staff
.
"
You
do
n't
win
any
medals
by
questioning
the
Chairman
's
judgement
,
Mark
"
said
his
personal
assistant
,
advising
him
to
"
tone
it
down
a
bit
"
in
future
Dublin
plant
reports
.
Notwithstanding
the
plant
's
poor
track
record
,
Tom
O'Reilly
considered
it
to
be
his
bounden
duty
to
respond
to
the
call
for
help
from
his
compatriot
,
the
Irish
Prime
Minister
,
and
so
he
phoned
McGillicuddy
,
who
readily
agreed
,
and
Mark
was
instructed
to
contact
the
PM
's
office
.
There
were
,
in
fact
,
many
Irish
Americans
in
United
Motors
at
high
management
levels
,
all
of
whom
had
a
nostalgic
affection
for
the
"
auld
counthrie
"
,
and
indeed
for
anything
Irish
;
but
that
was
because
most
of
them
had
never
actually
been
there
.
The
majority
preferred
to
believe
the
picturesque
stories
passed
down
by
parents
and
grandparents
,
which
were
,
of
course
,
accepted
as
the
gospel
truth
.
The
Chairman
,
for
example
,
was
one
of
no
fewer
than
five
Irish
Americans
to
have
held
the
top
job
in
UM
.
Tom
O'Reilly
was
an
ascetic
former
Treasurer
of
the
Corporation
who
had
been
never
known
to
smile
even
when
the
company
's
blue
chip
shares
soared
to
dizzy
peaks
on
Wall
Street
.
It
was
,
however
,
reported
by
his
personal
staff
that
he
did
manage
a
smirk
when
he
had
been
told
the
story
of
how
his
arch
rival
and
competitor
had
been
conned
by
his
countrymen
on
a
flag-flying
visit
to
the
auld
counthrie
.
He
had
agreed
to
make
a
financial
contribution
of
$50,000
from
the
family
trust
to
help
finance
a
social
club
to
be
named
after
him
.
The
local
paper
made
a
front
page
headline
of
"
Henry
's
magnificent
$590,000
gift
.
The
motor
magnate
was
furious
and
rang
the
Editor
to
say
so
,
whereupon
the
latter
apologised
profusely
adding
that
he
would
make
a
front
page
correction
in
the
next
day
's
edition
.
Henry
surrendered
.
Some
two
years
later
,
on
completion
of
the
social
club
,
the
magnate
was
asked
if
he
would
like
something
suitable
inscribed
over
the
portal
.
"
Yeah
,
"
replied
the
motor
man
irritably
,
"
you
can
say
"
I
came
amongst
you
and
you
took
me
in
"
.
"
Tom
O'Reilly
liked
that
story
.
It
actually
made
him
smirk
-
so
it
was
said
.
The
UM
Chairman
was
cast
from
a
similar
mould
but
with
coarser
ingredients
.
O'Reilly
was
impossible
to
please
and
suspicious
of
everybody
and
everything
.
He
trusted
nobody
,
not
even
fellow
Catholics
on
the
Board
.
But
if
it
could
be
said
that
he
did
have
a
weakness
for
something
,
it
was
for
Ireland
and
the
Irish
.
Mark
could
ill-afford
to
be
away
from
his
office
with
the
presentation
to
Cocello
looming
large
on
the
horizon
,
but
the
next
day
he
was
on
his
way
to
Dublin
.
The
taxi
crossed
the
Liffey
and
made
its
way
down
O'Connell
Street
to
Government
House
.
The
talkative
driver
had
n't
stopped
chatting
from
the
moment
Mark
had
entered
the
cab
.
He
was
better
than
a
music-hall
turn
.
There
was
no
question
of
doubt
but
that
the
Irish
had
been
blessed
with
the
gift
of
the
Blarney
.
Most
of
them
could
express
themselves
with
a
lilting
eloquence
which
left
the
English
spellbound
.
Who
was
it
who
said
that
the
Irish
took
the
English
language
and
threw
the
words
up
in
the
air
just
to
see
how
they
all
sparkled
as
they
came
tumbling
down
?
Mark
's
meeting
with
the
Irish
Minister
of
Industry
and
his
loquacious
officials
was
pure
theatre
.
The
problems
experienced
by
United
Motors
at
its
Dublin
plant
,
which
the
Englishman
advised
were
the
major
factors
which
would
influence
future
investment
decisions
in
Ireland
,
simply
melted
away
into
insignificance
under
their
mellifluous
tongues
.
They
had
excuses
,
or
as
they
preferred
to
describe
them
,
fair
and
reasonable
explanations
,
for
all
the
problems
which
had
beset
the
Dublin
plant
.
The
exceptionally
high
absenteeism
on
Mondays
and
Fridays
,
which
necessitated
employing
thirty
per
cent
more
workers
than
was
economically
justified
,
was
not
so
much
caused
by
the
demon
drink
;
but
because
-
etcetera
,
etcetera
-
.
The
reason
why
timekeeping
was
particularly
bad
on
Tuesdays
,
Wednesdays
and
Thursdays
,
when
employees
did
turn
up
for
work
,
was
because
the
buses
were
so
unreliable
.
The
local
transport
authority
simply
could
n't
get
spare
parts
from
the
British
to
keep
the
buses
on
the
roads
.
If
only
the
British
would
pull
their
socks
up
things
would
be
different
.
The
reason
why
absenteeism
was
non-existent
on
Thursdays
was
not
just
because
it
happened
to
be
pay
day
.
Ah
ha
,
no
;
it
was
n't
quite
as
simple
as
all
that
,
do
n't
you
know
,
although
of
course
it
was
an
incentive
day
,
and
the
Irish
loved
incentives
.
Regarding
the
strikes
,
disputes
and
restrictive
practices
which
had
plagued
the
Dublin
plant
,
these
were
all
unfortunate
legacies
of
the
British
system
which
had
been
foisted
upon
the
Irish
since
before
the
First
World
War
.
The
Irish
Government
was
resolutely
determined
to
rid
itself
of
the
British
system
which
had
done
so
much
harm
to
the
economy
.
When
Mark
reminded
them
that
the
plant
was
relatively
new
and
that
with
the
exception
of
the
American
Managing
Director
and
Treasurer
,
was
manned
throughout
by
Irish
men
and
women
,
they
countered
with
,
"
Ah
yes
,
but
it
's
the
Trade
unions
,
you
see
.
"
And
when
he
pointed
out
that
these
were
Irish
,
not
British
Trade
unions
they
were
talking
about
,
it
was
sadly
admitted
that
the
English
disease
had
poisoned
the
minds
of
many
impressionable
Irish
trade
unionists
and
that
it
would
of
course
take
time
entirely
to
eradicate
malign
English
influences
from
the
land
of
Saints
and
Scholars
.
To
be
sure
,
unemployment
was
a
mortal
sin
to
shame
all
good
Christians
and
the
Government
was
appealing
to
international
companies
to
help
solve
the
problem
.
Meantime
,
it
would
greatly
help
if
United
Motors
could
see
its
way
clear
to
build
another
factory
in
Ireland
,
particularly
if
it
could
be
built
in
the
South
West
,
where
the
Prime
Minister
was
having
to
face
re-election
in
a
year
's
time
.
Very
generous
financial
assistance
would
be
given
by
the
Government
,
in
the
form
of
a
grant
of
up
to
thirty
per
cent
of
capital
and
remission
of
all
taxation
on
export
sales
for
ten
years
.
The
fact
that
in
the
whole
of
South
West
Ireland
there
was
not
sufficient
labour
to
man
a
new
United
Motors
plant
was
not
seen
by
the
Minister
as
any
kind
of
problem
;
simply
as
a
little
local
difficulty
.
Later
that
morning
he
was
flown
to
the
South
West
and
shown
a
beautiful
industrial
site
with
excellent
access
to
the
adjacent
port
facilities
.
Unfortunately
it
had
just
been
earmarked
for
housing
.
There
was
,
however
,
another
very
similar
site
in
the
area
,
which
was
really
better
than
the
site
they
had
already
seen
.
The
trouble
was
that
nobody
could
quite
remember
where
it
was
exactly
,
but
everybody
knew
it
was
around
there
somewhere
,
that
's
for
sure
.
So
they
all
went
off
to
lunch
with
the
mayor
,
while
a
messenger
was
sent
to
the
Registrar
of
Births
,
Marriages
and
Deaths
to
get
the
necessary
information
.
Mark
had
often
said
to
his
American
colleagues
in
Detroit
and
New
York
that
the
sales
'
promotion
literature
put
out
by
the
Irish
Development
Authority
to
attract
internationally
mobile
inward
investment
was
superior
to
anything
produced
by
any
other
European
country
.
Unfortunately
the
practical
problems
of
operating
a
large
plant
in
Ireland
were
totally
unrelated
to
the
glowing
words
in
the
glossy
literature
,
and
to
the
enchanting
phrases
which
slid
so
eloquently
off
the
honeyed
tongues
of
Ministers
and
officials
.
In
reality
,
the
unhappy
experiences
of
United
Motors
at
its
Dublin
plant
had
effectively
ensured
that
no
major
future
expansion
would
be
undertaken
in
that
enigmatic
country
for
many
years
.
Cocello
would
effectively
see
to
that
,
whatever
Chairman
Tom
O'Reilly
might
think
.
When
the
Minister
had
ended
the
meeting
with
the
words
,
"
Now
,
Mr
Sanders
,
what
can
we
do
to
persuade
you
to
put
more
investment
in
Ireland
?
"
the
Englishman
had
replied
,
"
The
best
advocate
you
could
have
,
Minister
,
to
influence
more
investment
in
your
country
,
is
a
local
plant
manager
who
consistently
turns
in
good
results
,
year
after
year
.
"
Such
a
man
,
with
a
good
track
record
can
fight
for
his
plant
and
his
people
on
the
very
strong
grounds
that
investment
in
his
region
has
been
proven
to
be
successful
.
"
Our
Dublin
plant
has
consistently
failed
to
produce
the
expected
results
,
and
it
is
this
unfortunate
experience
which
will
weigh
heavily
against
any
further
investment
in
Eire
;
in
much
the
same
way
as
it
has
weighed
heavily
against
the
UK
.
The
most
eloquent
advocates
in
United
Motors
,
Minister
,
are
those
with
beautiful
bottom
lines
,
"
said
the
Englishman
.
The
executive
jet
took
off
from
Cork
airport
and
landed
at
Dublin
in
the
late
afternoon
.
Mark
was
driven
to
the
Gresham
Hotel
by
the
head
of
the
development
authority
.
On
the
way
he
stopped
the
car
in
the
city
centre
to
point
out
dozens
of
parking
meters
,
all
capped
with
hooded
covers
.
"
Now
I
'd
like
to
show
you
sometin'
which
I
'm
sure
you
would
appreciate
,
"
he
said
pleasantly
,
wagging
a
finger
at
the
objects
ahead
.
"
Now
you
see
all
dose
little
parking
meters
dere
,
snoozing
under
dose
little
black
sleeping
caps
?
Well
a
few
weeks
ago
the
city
fathers
installed
dose
nasty
little
tings
at
a
cost
,
believe
it
or
not
,
sir
,
of
some
turty
tree
tousand
pounds
,
and
the
day
atterwards
dey
declared
the
whole
area
a
no
waiting
zone
.
"
He
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
.
"
Now
is
n't
dat
Irish
,
Mr
Sanders
?
"
he
exclaimed
enjoying
the
joke
on
himself
,
which
was
one
of
the
more
agreeable
characteristics
the
Irish
had
in
common
with
the
English
.
Mark
then
told
him
of
the
occasion
when
he
had
been
driving
down
O'Connell
Street
some
twenty
or
so
years
before
,
when
he
had
inadvertently
misunderstood
the
hand
signals
of
the
policeman
on
traffic
duty
,
and
had
moved
off
before
he
had
been
cleared
to
do
so
.
The
policeman
had
ordered
him
to
stop
by
his
foot
.
"
You
are
English
,
are
you
not
,
Sor
?
"
he
had
asked
with
haughty
disdain
.
"
Sure
,
I
taut
so
,
"
he
added
.
"
Now
sor
,
is
dis
your
first
rime
in
Dublin
?
Ah
it
is
.
For
sure
dat
explains
it
all
!
"
Then
pulling
himself
up
to
a
great
height
,
he
went
on
.
"
Now
sor
,
I
'm
goin'
to
be
tellin'
yer
sometin'
.
If
you'se
happen
to
be
comin'

at
some
time
or
other
in

future

which
praise
the
Lord
you
will
be

down

Street
and

with

arms
up
;
then
whether
I

here
or

you
stop

"
He
had
stood
there
with
left
arm
aloft
and
right
arm
horizontal
and
remained
in
that
statuesque
position
for
some
thirty
seconds
.
"
Now
,
is
dat
understood
,
sor
?
Fine
,
then
be
off

and

good

.
"
The
other
Ireland
raised
its
ugly
head
at
Dublin
airport
.
Mark
's
name
had
been
called
over
the
loudspeaker
system
.
He
answered
the
phone
to
be
told
by
an
anonymous
member
of
the
IRA
that
he
should
n't
attempt
to
return
to
Ireland
if
United
Motors
decided
against
further
investment
in
that
country
.
Once
again
the
sharp
contrast
was
drawn
between
the
charming
and
friendly
people
one
came
across
in
everyday
life
and
the
murdering
hate
of
the
evil
terrorist
minority
who
eagerly
blew
innocent
men
,
women
and
children
to
Kingdom
come
.
While
Mark
was
in
Dublin
the
head
of
the
French
Development
Authority
DATAR
paid
a
courtesy
visit
to
Detroit
to
make
the
point
to
Nate
Cocello
,
and
Chairman
,
Tom
O'Reilly
that
France
was
keen
to
attract
very
much
more
United
Motors
investment
.
The
fact
that
France
had
already
received
the
lion
's
share
of
new
European
component
investment
over
the
previous
five
years
was
beside
the
point
.
That
was
past
.
France
wanted
the
lion
's
share
of
all
future
European
investment
too
,
and
was
most
concerned
to
hear
that
the
Corporation
was
also
considering
investment
in
Spain
,
Portugal
,
Austria
,
Ireland
and
the
UK
.
It
was
put
to
the
two
top
men
and
to
the
Vice
President
in
charge
of
Overseas
'
Operations
that
the
interests
of
France
could
only
be
adequately
served
by
Frenchmen
,
and
not
by
Americans
or
Englishmen
.
The
fact
that
Sanders
,
an
Englishman
,
had
produced
the
plan
which
had
changed
French
plants
from
ailing
and
unprofitable
operations
in
the
sixties
,
into
expanding
and
profitable
divisions
in
the
seventies
was
discreetly
overlooked
.
Mark
had
actually
transferred
certain
expanding
and
profitable
product
lines
and
manufacturing
facilities
from
the
UK
to
France
to
consolidate
a
new
range
of
components
at
French
locations
.
All
hell
would
have
been
let
loose
by
the
French
plants
and
the
French
Government
if
the
boot
had
been
on
the
other
foot
and
anyone
had
attempted
to
transfer
products
and
facilities
from
France
to
the
UK
.
The
top
men
had
listened
courteously
to
their
visitor
's
observations
and
requests
without
reaction
.
Under
his
breath
,
the
Vice
President
was
telling
him
to
get
stuffed
.
The
French
Government
would
object
to
Jesus
Christ
being
head
of
European
Operations
,
on
the
grounds
that
He
was
n't
a
Frenchman
.
In
his
capacity
as
world-wide
planning
coordinator
,
Mueller
had
been
invited
by
Nate
Cocello
to
attend
the
meeting
as
an
observer
.
He
had
listened
to
DATAR
"
s
views
with
great
interest
,
and
from
a
totally
different
viewpoint
to
that
of
the
Vice
President
.
Mueller
wanted
to
bring
world
planning
under
his
personal
direction
and
control
from
Detroit
.
He
could
understand
-
so
he
said
to
the
top
brass
after
the
Frenchman
had
departed
-
why
the
French
took
exception
to
an
Englishman
holding
such
a
key
position
in
Europe
.
He
could
also
understand
why
they
objected
to
London
being
the
European
headquarters
of
United
Motors
.
Chairman
Tom
O'Reilly
took
a
similar
view
but
for
different
reasons
.
He
had
been
against
the
choice
of
London
as
the
location
for
European
Headquarters
when
he
had
been
Treasurer
.
As
an
active
supporter
of
the

"
Mark
Sanders
spent
the
next
few
days
in
his
office
,
working
late
into
the
night
to
finalise
the
ten
year
European
Business
Plan
and
to
summarise
the
massive
document
into
a
sixty
minute
presentation
illustrated
by
thirty
slides
.
Fred
Klepner
had
been
in
and
out
of
both
Mark
's
and
Pat
Muldoon
's
offices
,
which
were
only
a
few
yards
apart
,
like
an
eager
beaver
.
He
would
grab
a
completed
section
of
the
overall
plan
from
Mark
's
private
secretary
just
as
soon
as
she
had
typed
it
,
and
dash
off
to
his
own
office
down
the
corridor
to
study
it
carefully
many
times
over
,
before
taking
it
along
to
Muldoon
to
keep
him
in
the
picture
.
Klepner
played
the
usual
corporate
cat
and
mouse
game
of
making
at
least
one
or
two
word
changes
on
each
and
every
page
so
that
his
own
secretary
could
re-type
each
page
under
her
initials
and
the
initials
"
FK
"
.
This
practice
achieved
twin
objectives
.
It
gave
the
European
plan
anonymity
by
not
identifying
the
author
of
the
plan
,
while
his
own
copy
under
his
own
initials
and
those
of
his
secretary
would
tell
Mueller
and
his
Detroit
colleagues
that
he
had
a
hand
in
its
formulation
,
which
is
what
Mueller
and
Muldoon
wanted
people
to
think
.
As
presentation
day
grew
closer
with
Mark
racing
against
time
to
complete
the
plan
and
finalise
the
slide
illustrations
,
so
Klepner
read
and
re-read
it
until
he
had
almost
learnt
it
off
by
heart
.
So
complete
was
his
total
immersion
in
the
subject
that
he
actually
began
to
believe
that
he
had
assisted
Sanders
in
the
plan
's
preparation
.
His
delusions
were
those
of
a
messenger
boy
who
assumes
that
because
he
takes
the
Chief
Architect
's
drawings
to
the
print
room
,
he
has
played
a
leading
role
in
the
design
of
the
building
.
A
few
days
before
the
European
Planning
Committee
was
due
to
meet
,
Mueller
decided
to
go
for
the
jugular
.
His
suggestion
that
United
Motors
should
progressively
wind
up
its
European
,
South
American
and
Asian
regional
headquarters
and
plan
,
direct
and
control
world
operations
from
its
home
base
in
Detroit
,
had
been
well-received
by
most
of
the
top
brass
who
liked
the
big
bold
approach
of
running
the
world
the
way
it
used
to
be
-
from
Detroit
.
They
were
under
no
illusions
that
they
could
do
a
better
job
from
Detroit
,
but
they
had
become
increasingly
concerned
that
they
were
getting
out
of
touch
with
what
was
happening
around
the
world
,
and
that
the
tail
was
beginning
to
wag
the
dog
.
The
European
zone
,
for
example
,
was
growing
twice
as
fast
as
the
United
States
'
zone
,
and
now
employed
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
.
This
situation
went
against
the
grain
,
as
the
top
brass
always
needed
to
be
on
top
of
every
situation
and
on
top
of
every
executive
if
they
were
to
do
their
jobs
to
their
own
satisfaction
;
not
necessarily
in
the
best
interests
of
the
Corporation
,
that
is
to
say
,
but
in
their
own
best
interests
.
Mueller
's
proposals
appeared
to
be
more
in
tune
with
their
own
thoughts
at
that
particular
time
.
For
this
reason
he
was
given
the
green
light
to
prepare
more
detailed
proposals
for
further
consideration
.
Confident
in
the
knowledge
that
he
now
had
the
general
support
of
most
of
the
top
brass
to
his
world
control
plan
,
Mueller
considered
that
he
was
now
in
a
much
stronger
position
to
start
pulling
the
rug
out
from
under
the
Regional
Area
Managers
.
And
,
as
the
biggest
zone
by
far
was
Europe
,
he
would
begin
there
.
His
plan
to
appoint
Klepner
to
succeed
Sanders
as
European
Planning
Manager
,
based
on
Detroit
rather
than
London
,
was
working
out
to
perfection
.
Klepner
had
been
doing
everything
that
was
expected
of
him
acting
as
Mueller
's
eyes
and
ears
in
Europe
.
It
was
now
necessary
to
give
Klepner
visibility
in
front
of
Cocello
and
the
top
brass
.
Muldoon
was
no
problem
.
He
would
n't
mind
taking
early
retirement
.
He
was
over
sixty
and
a
relatively
wealthy
man
,
with
a
wife
who
was
financially
independent
.
He
would
welcome
the
chance
of
retiring
to
his
yachts
.
McGillicuddy
would
n't
relish
the
idea
of
giving
up
the
General
Director
's
job
as
European
overlord
,
but
he
was
also
sixty
and
could
be
kicked
upstairs
for
a
year
or
so
before
taking
early
retirement
.
H
e
certainly
would
n't
be
short
of
a
dollar
or
two
.
Sanders
was
a
bit
of
a
problem
.
He
was
in
his
early
fifties
and
could
n't
be
retired
early
,
except
on
a
very
much
reduced
company
pension
.
But
-
so
what
?
He
could
count
himself
lucky
to
have
got
where
he
had
got
in
an
all-American
company
.
He
could
be
offered
an
MD
job
in
one
of
the
UK
divisions
which
he
would
obviously
turn
down
;
but
so
what
!
From
now
on
the
locals
would
do
what
they
were
told
to
do
by
Detroit
,
and
if
they
did
n't
like
it
they
could
take
the
option
of
either
getting
out
of
their
own
free
will
,
or
being
booted
out
.
He
'd
had
enough
of
all
that
European
political
crap
about
overseas
subsidiaries
also
having
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
local
host
country
where
United
Motors
had
a
manufacturing
presence
.
Bullshit
.
Their
one
and
only
interest
was
to
serve
the
interest
of
the
Corporation
in
the
US
of
A
and
anyone
in
a
top
position
overseas
who
did
n't
understand
that
number
one
lesson
would
soon
have
his
nose
put
out
of
joint
.
From
here
on
in
,
Randy
Mueller
was
going
to
start
calling
the
shots
.
He
reckoned
that
his
chances
of
making
the
Presidency
before
he
was
sixty
were
now
better
than
ever
.
He
should
make
a
Vice
Presidency
within
five
,
the
Presidency
within
ten
.
President
Randy
Mueller
,
the
all-American
boy
who
had
made
it
from
right
here
in
his
little
ole
home
town
of
Detroit
.
He
rose
from
his
enormous
desk
and
lit
a
big
cigar
-
it
could
n't
have
been
a
Havana
-
and
strutted
around
his
vast
office
like
a
peacock
,
admiring
his
reflection
in
the
long
mirror
.
Randy
loved
himself
and
everything
he
stood
for
.
It
was
surely
great
to
be
an
American
going
up
in
the
greatest
company
in
the
world
and
in
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
.
God
bless
America
,
and
piss
on
the
rest
.
He
walked
to
the
phone
,
pausing
on
the
way
to
take
another
admiring
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror

a

components
from

European
plants

manufactured

that

"
"
Well
,
I
hear
what
you
're
sayin'
Randy
,
but
I
do
n't
necessarily
agree
with
ya

Mark
was
asked
by
McGillicuddy
for
some
ideas
by
which
European
plants
could
reduce
corporate
operating
costs
on
a
world
wide
basis
.
Mark
's
right
.
European
component
manufacturing
costs
are
lower
than
in
the
States
,
and
we
could
save
the
Corporation
around
a
billion
dollars
a
year
by
purchasin'
components
from
our
European
plants
.
So
what
's
wrong
with
puttin'
it
up
for
discussion
?
"
"
Because
the
US
components

n't

na

's

a
full
scale
fight
on
our
hands
with
those
guys
if
we
went
ahead
with
that
proposal
!
"
"
Yeah
,
but
hang
on
a
minute
,
Randy
.
Is
n't
that
exactly
what
you
are
proposing
to
do
in
reverse
?
You
and
the
Corporation
have
been
telling
us
to
purchase
from
our
new
subsidiaries
in
Taiwan
,
Korea
,
Singapore
and
even
from
Japan
,
for
God
's
sake
.
Mark
has
told
you

many
times
that
European
Governments
and
European
plant
people
ai
n't
gon
na

that
one
little
bit
,
particularly
when
their
own
Far
East
markets
are
heavily
protected
.
So
what
's
different
about
Mark
's
plan
to
sell
components
from
our
European
plants
into
the
United
States
,
if
we
can
save
the
Corporation
a
billion

a

"
Muldoon
lowered
the
phone
slowly
,
shaking
his
head
sadly
.
My
God
,
what
was
the
Corporation
coming
to
when
unscrupulous
people
like
Mueller
were
influencing
its
future
and
the
destinies
of
countless
loyal
,
hardworking
and
respected
executives
on
overseas
operations
?
What
in
the
world
would
the
company
be
like
in
a
few
years
'
time
if
such
people
were
in
the
driving
seat
?
Well
the
answer
to
that
question
,
he
supposed
,
was
that
there
would
n't
be
an
overseas
Corporation
to
worry
about
.
What
would
be
the
world
reaction
when
the
full
implications
of
the
new
World
Car
Plan
under
the
new
centralised
organisation
became
more
obvious
?
What
would
be
the
reaction
of
local
managers
,
of
Governments
,
of
the
employees
and
the
unions
?
He
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
all
the
potential
conflict
situations
ahead
.
He
was
glad
he
was
getting
out
.
Mark
could
hardly
believe
his
ears
when
,
two
days
before
the
EPC
meeting
,
Muldoon
told
him
that
Nate
wanted
him
to
fly
out
to
Istanbul
right
away
.
It
was
true
that
a
major
problem
had
just
cropped
up
which
demanded
immediate
attention
.
The
Corporation
's
major
vehicle
assembler
in
Turkey
was
in
serious
difficulties
,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
new
Government
had
slapped
an
embargo
on
the
importation
of
components
to
conserve
its
diminishing
currency
reserves
.
United
Motors
had
received
two
urgent
requests
for
assistance
;
one
from
the
local
Managing
Director
,
who
needed
help
to
resolve
his
serious
plant
problems
,
and
the
other
from
the
Turkish
Prime
Minister
requesting
UM
investment
support
to
reduce
the
country
's
massive
trade
imbalance
.
All
this
was
fact
.
The
fiction
was
that
Nate
had
instructed
Mueller
to
arrange
to
get
Sanders
down
there
quickly
,
when
he
had
done
no
such
thing
.
Muldoon
spun
the
line
that
the
deteriorating
situation
in
Turkey
was
clearly
more
important
right
now
than
the
EPC
meeting
.
Events
there
were
taking
much
the
same
course
as
they
had
in
Portugal
,
and
as
Mark
had
resolved
that
problem
in
double
quick
time
,
he
was
considered
the
best
man
to
deal
with
this
new
problem
situation
.
All
very
flattering
,
but
-
.
The
Englishman
sensed
that
the
big
personal
build-up
was
a
blind
to
hide
Muldoon
's
real
reason
for
wanting
him
out
of
the
country
.
He
knew
full
well
that
the
only
circumstances
in
which
a
regional
planning
manager
would
not
be
expected
personally
to
present
his
Ten
Year
Business
Plan
to
the
President
of
the
Corporation
was
if
he
was
already
earmarked
for
promotion
and
it
was
desired
to
give
visibility
to
his
successor
,
or
if
he
was
on
his
way
out
.
Mark
knew
that
he
would
never
be
promoted
after
the
Steiner
incident
so
he
concluded
he
must
indeed
be
on
his
way
out
,
or
being
moved
sideways
.
Sensing
the
game
which
was
being
played
,
he
decided
to
throw
several
balls
in
the
air
for
Muldoon
to
catch
,
if
he
could
.
So
he
said
that
he
would
take
the
next
available
flight
to
Turkey
immediately
after
the
EPC
meeting
.
No
,
that
was
no
good
.
Istanbul

expecting

Meetings

been

up

Nate
wanted
him
there
straight
away

the

Well

Mark
said

'll

"
No

Muldoon
replied
hurriedly
.
"
It
was
Nate
himself

had
the
meetings
fixed
up

he
would

them

nothing

Mark
insisted
.

nothing
,

ever
allowed

's
the
future

'll
be
talking

"
Yes
,
I
know
that

Mark

the
American
countered
.
"
But
Nate
has
specifically
said
that

man

fly

I
'll
have

"
But
you

my
bailiwick

countered
the
Englishman
,
with
growing
resentment
in
his
voice
and
manner
.
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
Mark
,
but
-
.
"
The
American
could
n't
continue
the
charade
any
longer
.
Lowering
his
head
,
he
said
,
"
I
'm
sorry
,
Mark
,
but
that
's
the
way
they
want
it

that
's
the
way
it
's
got
to
be

out
the
slides

They

all

n't
they
,
and
the
text
?
"
Mark
nodded
his
head
.
"
Yes
,
sure
.
Everything
's
finished
.
"
He
only
realised
the
finality
of
the
phrase
a
second
or
so
later
.
Muldoon
did
n't
know
quite
what
to
say
.
"
I
know
you
have
worked
your
arse
off
to
produce
the
plan

Mark
,
and
it
's
a
great
one
.
No
doubt
about
that
.
But
if
Detroit
has
its
reasons
,
it
has
its
reasons
.
It
's
as
simple
as
that
.
I
'll
hold
the
fort

fill
you

when
you
get
back
.
"
Mark
turned
towards
the
door
.
It
was
pointless
to
argue
further
.
Muldoon
was
simply
carrying
out
instructions
.
"
Fill
me
in
-
that
's
just
about
it

Pat

He
opened
the
door
and
turned
toward
the
American
.
Who
are
you
going
to
hand
the
presentation
over
to
,
after
you
have
given
the
introduction
?
"
he
asked
quietly
.
They
both
said
the
name
together
-
"
Klepner
.
"
Mark
was
sick
at
heart
as
he
drove
home
that
evening
.
He
had
a
blinding
headache
and
simply
was
n't
thinking
of
what
he
was
doing
as
he
swung
the
car
off
the
slip
road
to
enter
the
motorway
.
His
thoughts
were
fiercely
occupied
elsewhere
.
Without
even
glancing
in
the
mirror
,
he
crossed
the
inner
and
middle
lanes
into
the
fast
lane
and
,
in
fewer
than
ten
seconds
the
speedometer
needle
was
registering
one
hundred
and
fifteen
miles
an
hour
,
but
Mark
was
oblivious
of
the
fact
.
Suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
flashing
past
vehicles
which
appeared
to
be
dawdling
,
he
glanced
at
the
speedometer
.
He
was
doing
one
hundred
and
twenty
!
He
jerked
his
foot
off
the
accelerator
and
glanced
in
the
mirror
,
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
that
nobody
was
on
his
tail
.
Slowing
to
seventy
,
he
made
his
way
home
.
He
very
rarely
spoke
about
business
matters
to
Georgina
and
decided
on
reflection
against
recounting
the
day
's
events
except
to
say
that
he
was
leaving
for
Istanbul
in
the
morning
,
and
would
be
away
for
three
or
four
days
.
The
Tri-star
jet
was
two
hours
late
on
take-off
from
Heathrow
,
and
then
had
to
abort
on
the
runway
at
lift-off
point
due
to
a
sudden
failure
of
one
of
the
engines
.
The
pilot
slammed
the
powerful
jets
into
reverse
thrust
,
bringing
the
giant
plane
to
a
halt
just
before
he
ran
out
of
runway
.
In
a
very
matter-of-fact
voice
he
apologised
for
the
shut
down
,
due
to
engine
failure
,
adding
laconically
that
he
had
left
ten
thousand
pounds
worth
of
tyres
on
the
runway
.
"
British
Airways
will
not
be
at
all
pleased
with
me.
"
he
remarked
casually
.
"
There
goes
another
Brownie
point
.
"
By
the
time
the
plane
approached
Istanbul
in
the
late
afternoon
,
Mark
had
put
away
several
large
measures
of
single
malt
Scotch
.
Mechanically
he
had
taken
each
drink
offered
without
thinking
,
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
spent
the
entire
journey
staring
out
of
the
cabin
window
into
the
infinity
of
space
.
His
meeting
was
not
until
the
next
morning
,
so
he
could
switch
off
for
a
few
hours
.
He
needed
to
do
just
that
,
for
he
was
tired
,
morose
and
bitter
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
feeling
very
insecure
.
Gazing
out
into
the
blue
,
he
asked
himself
if
this
assignment
was
his
swan
song
.
Must
be
,
he
concluded
.
Nate
would
never
have
taken
him
off
the
presentation
if
he
was
n't
being
moved
sideways
or
demoted
.
But
why
?
To
make
way
for
Klepner
,
Mueller
's
pet
poodle
?
It
had
happened
before
,
to
make
way
for
Muldoon
.
Why
should
n't
it
happen
again
?
If
you
could
n't
trust
the
bastards
then
,
why
should
you
trust
them
now
?
He
closed
his
eyes
.
What
made
Nate
and
the
executive
committee
think
that
guys
like
Klepner
and
Mueller
knew
more
about
the
European
components
"
business
than
the
Europeans
?
What
the
hell
would
the
US
component
divisions
say
if
the
executive
committee
was
stupid
enough
to
appoint
Europeans
to
manage
components
operations
in
the
United
States
?
No
prizes
for
guessing
the
answer
to
that
question
.
The
blonde
hostess
leaned
across
him
to
re-charge
his
glass
for
the
umpteenth
time
.
His
favourite
Scotch
,
Glenlivet

easy
to
relax
and
forget
your
troubles
when
you
had
a
glass
of

in
your
hand

He
jerked
forward
with
a
start
to
find
the
hostess
fingering
with
his
seat-belt
clasp

"
Fred
Clasper
,
the
militant
Merseyside
convener
,
was
a
desperately
worried
man
.
Things
were
n't
going
at
all
well
within
the
UK
vehicle
Division
.
Even
his
own
notorious
plant
,
which
had
consistently
gone
downhill
for
ten
years
under
his
active
leadership
,
had
been
steadily
increasing
efficiency
and
output
for
several
weeks
without
interruption
.
Morale
on
the
shop
floor
was
higher
than
it
had
been
for
a
long
year
and
an
unhealthy
atmosphere
of
optimism
and
hope
pervaded
the
plant
.
Union
members
were
openly
expressing
the
view
that
there
was
a
real
chance
that
the
ailing
division
would
now
pull
out
of
its
dive
with
the
Peters
'
Plan
,
which
had
been
fully
supported
by
Bunker
and
a
two-thirds
majority
at
the
plant
.
To
Clasper
's
disgust
,
the
majority
had
voted
against
his
recommended
call
for
strike
action
and
he
now
sensed
all
too
painfully
that
he
was
beginning
to
lose
control
of
his
members
.
Management
was
once
again
managing
,
something
which
he
had
never
allowed
to
happen
during
his
ten
years
as
convener
.
Arising
from
Clem
Bunker
's
endorsement
of
the
plan
,
new
methods
had
been
introduced
which
were
greatly
increasing
earnings
through
higher
productivity
.
Restrictive
practices
,
which
Clasper
had
fought
so
hard
to
introduce
,
were
being
discarded
at
a
rate
of
knots
in
the
quest
to
increase
efficiency
,
output
and
earnings
.
As
a
lifelong
Communist
,
Clasper
knew
that
it
was
absolutely
essential
to
wrest
control
of
the
workers
away
from
the
plant
management
.
He
had
exercised
effective
control
of
the
labour
force
for
ten
years
at
the
giant
plant
and
had
been
able
to
bring
the
workers
out
on
strike
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
.
It
was
he
,
Clasper
,
who
dictated
to
management
the
size
of
the
labour
force
they
would
require
to
produce
a
given
number
of
products
,
regardless
of
any
figure
which
management
might
arrive
at
by
employing
accurately
measured
work
standards
.
If
in
effect
,
Clasper
said
that
three
men
must
be
employed
to
do
two
men
's
work
,
then
that
was
it
.
On
those
occasions
when
he
had
felt
the
need
to
demonstrate
his
power
to
management
,
he
would
create
an
instant
departmental
dispute
which
always
had
the
immediate
effect
of
lowering
that
day
's
efficiency
to
below
fifty
per
cent
.
Since
the
plant
manager
was
never
able
to
make
up
a
day
's
loss
of
output
which
pulled
down
his
monthly
overall
efficiency
figures
on
which
he
was
judged
,
it
was
never
difficult
for
Clasper
to
prove
his
point
.
As
he
had
always
succeeded
in
getting
his
own
way
,
the
workers
had
been
inclined
to
go
along
with
him
,
even
when
their
instincts
told
them
that
he
was
wrong
.
They
really
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
for
he
had
always
been
able
to
threaten
any
dissenters
,
or
strays
,
with
the
loss
of
their
union
cards
.
Successive
personnel
managers
had
always
caved
in
to
his
demands
as
they
knew
full
well
that
Clasper
would
win
a
stand-up
fight
.
Yet
an
uneasy
feeling
had
been
steadily
growing
among
the
ten
thousand
workers
employed
at
the
plant
that
the
benefits
which
Clasper
's
militancy
had
achieved
were
illusory
.
Increased
earnings
,
grabbed
as
a
result
of
strike
action
rather
than
earned
by
increased
productivity
and
profitability
had
always
been
subsequently
eaten
away
by
inflation
.
The
Corporation
was
also
no
longer
expanding
its
British
operations
,
in
marked
contrast
to
the
frequent
expansion
of
its
plants
in
Germany
,
Belgium
and
France
.
Every
long
service
worker
employed
at
the
plant
and
within
the
division
knew
that
union
restrictive
practices
had
lowered
productivity
to
below
the
levels
achieved
on
the
continent
.
These
more
loyal
long
service
employees
had
an
intuitive
feeling
that
the
division
would
ultimately
go
out
of
business
in
the
UK
if
it
continued
to
operate
in
the
way
it
had
behaved
over
the
previous
ten
years
.
Even
the
notoriously
militant
workers
at
the
Merseyside
plant
were
now
beginning
to
recognise
that
distinct
possibility
.
It
was
generally
recognised
that
Clasper
was
not
the
man
to
dismantle
restrictive
practices
,
nor
to
co-operate
with
management
to
make
the
necessary
improvements
in
labour
relations
if
they
were
to
keep
their
jobs
in
future
.
The
majority
now
believed
that
Bunker
's
more
realistic
approach
made
more
sense
.
Clasper
was
beginning
to
be
seen
by
his
own
members
for
what
he
really
was
:
a
born
agitator
and
troublemaker
who
was
great
to
have
around
when
plant
managements
behaved
like
bastards
because
he
was
one
too
and
would
give
as
good
as
he
got
in
a
stand-up
fight
.
But
he
certainly
was
n't
the
man
to
have
in
the
driving
seat
on
the
union
side
when
both
management
and
workers
were
striving
for
the
sheer
survival
of
the
company
,
and
needed
to
work
together
if
they
were
to
pull
through
.
It
was
being
said
quite
openly
on
the
factory
floor
that
the
only
place
Clasper
would
lead
them
to
was
the
end
of
the
dole
queue
.
The
Communist
convener
could
both
feel
and
see
that
he
was
losing
control
.
Fewer
workers
bothered
to
listen
to
him
when
he
called
meetings
to
protest
against
the
Peters

Plan
.
He
was
also
being
subjected
to
cat-calls
and
ridicule
.
At
one
such
meeting
a
heckler
had
got
a
great
round
of
cheers
from
the
assembled
throng
when
he
had
told
Clasper
to
get
off
his
bloody
soap-box
and
do
a
day
's
work
for
a
bloody
change
.
To
his
disgust
he
found
that
the
workers
would
no
longer
respond
to
his
call
for
mass
meetings
during
working
hours
.
They
now
told
him
,
in
no
uncertain
terms
,
that
if
he
had
something
important
to
communicate
,
he
could
do
it
in
the
plant
car
park
during
the
lunch
break
,
or
after
working
hours
.
They
were
not
disposed
to
lose
both
output
and
earnings
by
downing
tools
.
In
desperation
Clasper
called
a
private
meeting
of
the
hard
core
left-wing
stewards
under
his
convenership
,
who
could
always
be
relied
upon
to
fight
against
management
and
the
capitalist
system
.
The
British
people
had
just
elected
a
Conservative
Government
,
headed
by
Britain
's
first
ever
woman
Prime
Minister
,
who
had
already
earned
the
reputation
of
being
"
the
best
man
for
the
job
"
in
the
Conservative
Party
.
Within
days
of
taking
office
,
she
had
invited
Don
Peters
to
explain
the
problems
which
had
bedevilled
the
British
vehicle
plants
during
the
sixties
and
seventies
and
to
outline
his
company
's
plan
for
the
future
.
Living
up
to
her
reputation
,
Peters
found
that
she
had
done
her
homework
thoroughly
.
She
was
tough
and
uncompromising
.
She
noted
,
she
said
with
a
pained
expression
,
that
output
from
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
of
United
Motors
had
been
falling
steadily
over
the
previous
ten
years
.
At
the
same
time
,
UM
imports
had
been
steadily
rising
,
including
very
substantial
imports
from
UM
Vehicle
Divisions
on
the
Continent
which
had
greatly
expanded
their
total
output
and
exports
over
the
same
period
.
"
United
Motors
used
to
make
a
very
healthy
contribution
to
Britain
's
export
drive
.
Now
you
are
the
biggest
single
contributor
to
our
balance
of
payments
deficit
,
"
she
said
acidly
.
"
Trends
of
this
nature
do
n't
simply
happen
,
do
they
?
"
she
asked
with
feigned
innocence
.
"
It
has
to
be
planned
that
way
,
does
it
not
?
"
She
wanted
to
know
what
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
was
doing
to
correct
its
appalling
track
record
of
recent
years
,
particularly
when
compared
with
its
Continental
plants
.
She
then
ticked
off
several
points
she
wished
to
make
.
Don
Peters
had
been
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
the
Prime
Minister
's
forthright
manner
lived
up
to
her
advance
publicity
.
The
United
Kingdom
had
a
serious
balance
of
payments
problem
in
manufactured
goods
,
which
was
only
partly
disguised
by
the
revenue
beginning
to
flood
in
from
North
Sea
oil
,
which
had
a
limited
life
.
The
problem
had
been
seriously
aggravated
by
the
poor
performances
of
UK
vehicle
producers
-
his
own
company
foremost
among
them
-
and
the
Prime
Minister
naturally
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
doing
to
correct
the
adverse
trend
.
It
was
a
straightforward
and
most
pertinent
question
.
He
would
have
posed
the
same
question
if
he
had
been
sitting
in
her
position
.
For
nearly
half
an
hour
,
the
American
explained
the
plan
which
the
Corporation
had
recently
approved
.
He
then
answered
the
many
penetrating
questions
put
to
him
.
In
answer
to
one
such
question
,
he
replied
that
he
was
pleased
to
say
that
he
was
now
being
given
full
support
by
the
unions
which
drew
the
sharp
retort
-
.
"
NOT
BEFORE
TIME
!
"
Before
she
dismissed
him
she
said
unequivocally
that
it
was
the
Government
's
intention
to
rebuild
Britain
's
weakened
manufacturing
base
and
reduce
the
ever-growing
importation
of
manufactured
products
.
"
If
industry
does
n't
help
me
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
Government
,
we
will
have
to
take
appropriate
alternative
steps
,
"
she
had
said
with
a
steely
smile
.
"
But
I
hope
that
wo
n't
be
necessary
.
Thank
you
so
much
,
Mr
Peters
for
the
chat
.
Most
helpful
.
I
will
invite
you
to
dinner
when
you
correct
your
trade
imbalance

"
Mark
booked
into
The
Istanbul
Hilton
in
the
mid-evening
and
,
after
a
shower
,
returned
to
the
lobby
where
he
purchased
a
thriller
before
retiring
to
the
comfort
of
an
easy
chair
in
the
lounge
.
He
continued
to
drink
quietly
for
another
hour
before
going
in
to
dinner
.
Afterwards
he
adjourned
to
the
cocktail
bar
for
a
nightcap
.
He
was
now
feeling
pleasantly
intoxicated
from
the
effects
of
a
steady
supply
of
alcohol
,
which
had
lifted
his
flagging
spirits
.
He
was
now
more
at
peace
with
the
world
of
United
Motors
.
Sipping
a
large
Armagnac
and
enjoying
the
heady
aroma
of
a
Havana
cigar
,
he
had
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
life
could
,
and
would
go
on
.
Whatever
lay
ahead
,
maybe
it
was
for
the
best
.
All
is
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
,
he
mused
,
blowing
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
air
above
him
.
That
's
what
Voltaire
's
Pangloss
had
said
,
was
n't
it
?
And
just
look
at
the
problems
which
had
faced
poor
Candide
.
Maybe
it
was
time
for
a
change
,
anyway
.
Thirty
years
was
a
long
time
to
stay
with
one
company
.
Should
have
got
out
after
the
Steiner
incident

Fool
not
to
have
done
so

leaving
it
a
bit
late

Over

Do
I

"
There
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
man
,
which
taken
at
the
flood
,
leads
on
to
-
"
heaven
knows
what
and
where
.
A
voluptuous
blonde
hooker
in
a
long
white
gown
entered
the
spacious
bar
.
The
front
was
slashed
all
the
way
down
to
her
navel
to
reveal
rounded
breasts
,
which
rose
and
fell
temptingly
like
a
couple
of
ripe
peaches
.
Just
inside
the
entrance
,
she
turned
to
survey
the
clientele
,
making
sure
as
she
did
so
that
all
the
men
got
a
tantalising
glimpse
of
a
very
long
and
elegant
leg
exposed
through
a
side
slit
.
The
bar
was
fairly
full
,
with
groups
of
local
worthies
and
their
wives
and
a
clutch
of
broody
businessmen
.
From
the
attention
which
focused
on
her
,
it
was
obvious
that
the
blonde
would
make
a
sale
in
no
time
at
all
.
Eyes
turned
as
she
walked
slowly
across
the
room
,
brushing
by
this
man
and
that
.
To
his
surprise
,
she
stopped
when
she
reached
Mark
's
chair
and
took
the
vacant
seat
beside
him
,
nodding
casually
in
his
direction
and
flashing
a
devastating
smile
as
she
carefully
arranged
herself
on
display
.
She
crossed
her
slender
legs
very
slowly
so
that
the
panel
of
her
dress
fell
away
to
reveal
long
,
shapely
limbs
plus
a
glimpse
of
white
satin
briefs
.
Mark
smiled
the
appreciative
smile
of
a
man
who
was
just
looking
,
not
buying
.
Must
be
too
expensive
for
the
locals
,
he
mused
.
Perhaps
the
fiddle
sheet
did
n't
run
to
outside
entertainment
more
than
once
a
month
.
Soaring
inflation
,
perhaps
.
Up
sixty
per
cent
this
year
in
Turkey
,
he
'd
read
in
The
Financial
Times
.
No
-
wait
a
minute
.
Devaluation
of
the
Turkish
lira
.
Down
forty
per
cent
.
That
's
it
!
She
's
after
the
export
business
.
She
gives
a
much
better
exchange
rate
and
gets
forty
per
cent
more
lira
for
every
pound
,
deutschmark
or
dollar
she
takes
.
Not
bad
,
eh
,
when
you
're
giving
your
all
for
your
country
?
She
smiled
again
,
which
Mark
again
returned
,
even
though
he
was
not
in
the
running
.
Just
an
interested
bystander
,
studying
the
form
in
the
paddock
and
placing
bets
on
who
would
be
the
jockey
who
would
saddle
her
up
.
Chap
at
the
far
end
of
the
bar
in
a
grey
pin-stripe
clearly
fancied
his
chances
.
Been
ogling
her
up
and
down
ever
since
she
'd
entered
the
room
.
Down
boy
,
down
!
She
's
too
expensive
for
you
,
even
after
allowing
for
devaluation
.
Where
on
earth
were
the
Germans
?
They
could
afford
her
.
God
only
knows
how
many
lira
there
were
to
the
deutschmark
these
days
.
Must
be
bloody
millions

He
watched
her
fumble
for
an
intentionally
long
time
in
her
handbag
for
the
means
of
lighting
the
Turkish
cigarette
she
held
aloft
in
her
left
hand
,
only
a
foot
or
so
away
from
Mark
's
head
.
He
was
an
ungallant
swine
for
deliberately
not
coming
to
her
aid
,
but
in
truth
he
really
wanted
to
see
which
of
the
likely
lads
,
would
dash
forward
.
Surprisingly
,
there
were
no
punters
.
At
long
last
she
looked
up
imploringly
from
the
depths
of
her
tiny
handbag
,
which
prompted
Mark
to
produce
his
lighter
.
Thank

she
said
,
blowing
a
thin
wisp
of
smoke
in
the
air
.
"

thought
you

He
blinked
and
shook
his
head
to
bring
the

back
into
focus

His

really
was
slurred
now

A
few
minutes
later
,
feeling
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
after
the
last
Armagnac
had
been
downed
,
Mark
moved
unsteadily
into
the
lift
with
his
voluptuous
mate
.
As
they
entered
his
room
,
she
reversed
against
the
door
,
closing
it
with
her
bottom
.
Draping
her
arms
over
his
shoulders
,
she
cradled
his
head
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
,
pulling
him
toward
her
to
close
a
hungry
,
wet
open
mouth
on
his
.
Restlessly
exploring
with
an
eager
tongue
,
she
eased
his
jacket
from
his
shoulders
.
It
fell
noiselessly
to
the
thick
carpeted
floor
.
He
tugged
at
the
zip
on
the
back
of
her
dress
while
she
unbuttoned
his
shirt
and
removed
his
tie
.
She
let
the
dress
fall
,
pushing
him
away
gently
to
slip
out
of
tiny
white
satin
briefs
.
She
was
naked
as
she
drew
him
towards
her
.
Her
hands
slid
under
his
shirt
,
unbuckling
,
unzipping
,
thrusting
on
downwards
.
She
kissed
him
again
on
the
lips
before
mouth
followed
the
path
her
hands
were
taking
.
"
Do
you
like
me
?
"
she
whispered
.
"
Ask

silly
question

"
he
gasped
.
"
Fantastic

"
And
then
,
suddenly
,
without
warning
,
a
bomb-burst
of
excruciating
pain
exploded
inside
his
skull
and
sent
him
reeling
.
Head
clasped
in
hands
,
he
sprawled
on
the
bed
,
gasping
for
air
,
as
the
room
swayed
crazily
from
side
to
side
.
It
was
sheer
hell
.
Frightened
by
what
had
happened
,
the
girl
bent
nervously
over
him
.
"
Are
you
all
right
?
"
she
asked
tremulously
,
taking
care
not
to
touch
him
.
He
struggled
breathlessly
to
find
the
words
.
"
Yes
-

all
right

terrible
pain

few
minutes

"
She
looked
at
the
crumpled
figure
who
was
fighting
for
breath
on
the
pillow
,
perspiration
pouring
down
his
anguished
face
.
"
Shall
I
get
you
a
drink

she
asked
.
He
nodded
.
"
Scotch

.
"
"
Cigarette

"
she
asked
.
"
No
.
"
She
poured
two
glasses
and
gave
him
one
.
In
the
semi-darkness
Mark
could
see
her
movements
.
She
had
a
most
beautiful
body
which
looked
opalescent
in
the
half
light
.
He
took
a
gulp
at
the
Scotch
and
gave
a
wry
smile
at
the
injustices
of
this
world
which
caused
him
to
be
smitten
with
another
one
of
those
blinding
attacks
just
when
he
was
about
to
make
it
.
Well
,
they
always
said
it
was
the
only
way
to
go
and
he
believed
it
.
He
was
perspiring
heavily
as
he
sipped
his
drink
,
gazing
wistfully
at
the
voluptuous
creature
who
stood
naked
before
him
in
the
half
light
with
a
look
of
scared
concern
on
her
young
face
.
"

she
asked

at

He
moved
himself
into
a
reclining
position
,
head
against
the
padded
headrest
.
The
room
started
to
sway
again
and
the
pains
in
his
head
intensified

sweating
face

sat
on

brow

He
closed

eyes

thought
.
More
than
just
a

grey
hairs
here

there

Plenty
of
lines
on
his
face

which
she
had
n't
really
noticed
before
,

which
were
particularly
noticeable
now

No
matter

They
gave
him
character

sex
appeal

thought

continued
to

the

dabbed
his
forehead
.
"

whispered

was

exhausted

She
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
lips
and
rose
from

bed

get
dressed

Taking

opened

took
out
two
twenties

Mark
woke
to
the
strangely
sad
and
beautiful
cry
of
the
Muezzin
,
whose
plaintive
voice
drifted
across
the
ancient
city
to
greet
another
dawn
.
The
pains
in
his
head
had
subsided
,
but
he
felt
dizzy
and
sick
,
which
he
concluded
was
not
surprising
,
considering
the
amount
of
alcohol
he
had
drunk
the
day
before
.
He
attempted
to
go
to
the
bathroom
,
but
found
that
his
left
leg
would
n't
respond
.
It
felt
heavy
and
lifeless
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
it
had
felt
that
day
in
Spain
when
he
had
gone
off
the
road
.
He
rolled
on
to
his
side
and
rubbed
the
leg
vigorously
with
his
right
hand
.
After
a
few
minutes
he
heaved
himself
out
of
bed
,
but
his
leg
let
him
down
and
he
fell
backwards
.
From
a
sitting
position
he
rubbed
and
thumped
the
leg
until
it
responded
sufficiently
for
him
to
drag
himself
to
the
bathroom
.
It
was
five
o'clock
.
Hauling
himself
back
to
bed
he
lay
awake
for
some
time
,
before
falling
asleep
.
When
he
awoke
again
it
was
seven
.
To
his
great
relief
he
found
that
the
pains
in
his
head
had
almost
gone
and
that
he
could
now
move
his
left
leg
,
albeit
with
some
difficulty
.
After
a
while
he
was
able
to
stand
.
He
then
walked
slowly
and
gingerly
towards
the
bathroom
,
keeping
as
much
weight
as
possible
on
his
right
leg
.
A
hot
bath
,
followed
by
a
cold
shower
worked
wonders
for
his
circulation
,
and
he
was
now
able
to
move
more
freely
,
though
still
with
a
pronounced
limp
.
He
shaved
,
got
dressed
and
took
the
elevator
to
the
breakfast-room
.
He
felt
in
reasonable
shape
,
as
he
entered
the
local
MDs
office
.
Nate
Cocello
,
President
of
United
Motors
,
had
flown
into
London
from
Detroit
with
a
posse
of
Vice
Presidents
to
attend
the
bi-monthly
meeting
of
the
European
Planning
committee
.
Chauffeurs
had
met
them
at
their
Inn
on
the
Park
hotel
,
at
seven
o'clock
sharp
;
and
at
five
minutes
to
eight
they
had
taken
their
seats
around
the
long
elliptical
table
at
European
headquarters
to
ensure
the
meeting
began
on
time
,
at
precisely
eight
o'clock
.
Randy
Mueller
was
darting
from
one
Vice
President
to
another
like
an
agitated
blue-bottle
.
He
was
first
on
with
his
presentation
,
and
had
been
there
since
six-thirty
to
make
sure
there
were
no
slip-ups
with
his
slide
presentation
.
He
began
by
saying
how
glad
he
was
to
be
in
Europe
again
,
which
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
outline
some
of
the
developments
taking
place
in
other
regions
of
the
world
,
and
to
describe
the
next
phase
in
the
development
of
the
world
car
.
He
highlighted
the
different
approaches
being
made
by
the
regions
,
putting
sufficient
emphasis
on
the
distinctions
and
duplications
to
enable
the
assembled
company
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
:
namely
,
that
the
international
business
was
getting
too
big
for
the
regions
to
handle
,
and
that
the
variations
would
lead
to
unnecessary
proliferation
if
they
were
n't
effectively
controlled
and
directed
by
Detroit
.
European
General
Director
Clancy
McGillicuddy
coughed
and
spluttered
at
the
innuendo
and
the
local
European
Managing
Directors
were
n't
exactly
overjoyed
.
They
cast
furtive
glances
at
one
another
.
Nate
Cocello
allowed
a
knowing
smile
to
cross
his
face
at
what
he
knew
would
be
the
natural
reactions
of
line
managers
.
He
had
been
one
himself
.
Mueller
strode
through
the
presentation
aggressively
.
Was
there
any
other
way
?
Throwing
up
slides
to
make
a
point
here
,
and
stepping
aside
from
the
podium
to
develop
a
theme
there
,
he
exuded
great
confidence
in
the
future
of
the
great
corporation
.
He
ended
his
presentation
of
forty-five
minutes
precisely
,
with
the
words
,
"
We
have
been
the
number
one
in
the
United
States
for
many
years
,
now
we
aim
to
be
the
number
one
in
Europe
,
in
South
America
,
the
Middle
East
-
.
"
"
And
all
stations
west
of
downtown
Detroit
,
"
whispered
Don
Peters
under
his
breath
.
The
President
and
Chief
Executive
Officer
looked
around
the
table
.
Spotting
Muldoon
,
he
asked
,
"
Any
comments
,
Pat
,
from
a
components
viewpoint
?
"
"
Not
at
this
stage
,
"
Muldoon
replied
nervously
.
"
How
about
you
,
Mark
-
.
"
began
the
top
man
,
his
eyes
searching
the
long
table
for
the
Englishman
.
"
Say
,
where
is
Mark
?
"
he
asked
,
not
being
able
to
spot
him
.
"
He
's
here
,
is
n't
he
?
,
There
was
an
uncomfortable
and
meaningful
silence
.
Other
executives
had
already
asked
themselves
the
same
question
.
The
main
item
on
the
agenda
was
the
Components
"
Business
Plan
.
It
was
really
Mark
's
show
.
Where
the
hell
was
he
?
"
Ah
-
.
He
could
n't
make
it
,
"
Muldoon
replied
breathlessly
.
"
Fred
Klepner
here
is
standing
in
.
That
's
right
,
Randy
,
is
n't
it
?
"
he
asked
,
calling
across
the
table
to
get
the
question
off
his
back
.
"
Yeah
,
Nate
,
"
Mueller
interjected
confidently
.
"
We
got
problems
in
Turkey
.
Mark
was
out
there
at
the
time
,
so
we
asked
him
to
help
us
sort
it
out
.
He
's
taking
a
few
days
"
vacation
out
there
,
right
now
,
so
Pat
and
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
let
Fred
Klepner
stand
in
.
He
's
been
helping
Mark
put
together
the
Business
Plan
and
the
presentation
.
That
's
right
Pat
,
is
n't
it
?
"
he
asked
,
getting
the
tricky
subject
off
his
shoulders
.
"
Yeah
.
That
's
right
,
Randy
,
"
the
nervous
American
replied
,
almost
choking
on
the
words
.
The
top
man
was
both
amazed
and
damned
angry
that
Mark
was
n't
there
.
Dammit
,
the
Components
Plan
was
the
main
subject
on
the
agenda
.
He
himself
had
specifically
told
Mark
and
Muldoon
that
he
proposed
to
attend
the
meeting
.
What
was
more
important
than
that
?
And
surely
,
nobody
in
his
right
mind
would
take
a
few
days
'
vacation
and
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
of
selling
his
own
plans
and
proposals
to
the
President
of
the
Corporation
?
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
his
face
expressing
his
thoughts
.
Every
executive
around
the
table
could
see
that
he
was
visibly
annoyed
by
the
Englishman
's
absence
.
They
were
under
no
illusions
.
If
the
Englishman
had
n't
blotted
his
copybook
before
,
he
certainly
had
now
.
"
O
K.
Let's
move
on
,
"
said
the
President
after
a
long
and
pregnant
pause
.
"
Ye
Gods
!
"
he
muttered
,
loud
enough
for
all
to
hear
.
"
Can
you
beat
it
!
"
The
components
presentation
came
on
after
lunch
.
Muldoon
nervously
introduced
the
plan
,
saying
that
as
Fred
Klepner
had
been
over
on
special
assignment
from
Detroit
to
help
Mark
in
the
final
preparation
of
the
Plan
and
the
presentation
,
he
would
hand
over
to
Fred
and
let
him
take
the
committee
through
the
proposals
.
Klepner
's
big
moment
had
arrived
and
the
ex-Harvard
Business
School
man
strode
confidently
to
the
podium
.
He
had
worked
long
hours
to
acquire
a
complete
understanding
of
the
Plan
and
to
learn
Mark
's
presentation
word
for
word
.
He
proceeded
to
explain
the
Plan
,
starting
with
a
brief
review
of
the
world
components
market
which
positioned
Europe
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
led
straight
into
the
Plan
.
The
political
and
economic
background
and
outlook
was
described
,
country
by
country
,
together
with
the
principal
assumptions
on
which
the
Plan
was
based
.
This
led
into
a
technical
and
commercial
appraisal
of
European
competition
and
the
anticipated
market
changes
over
the
next
ten
years
.
Existing
low
profit
products
were
to
be
corrected
with
a
cost
reduction
and
profit
improvement
plan
,
or
chased
out
where
such
improvements
were
not
economically
feasible
.
New
products
were
to
be
introduced
with
new
plants
to
be
located
from
a
short
list
of
low
cost
countries
:
namely
Spain
,
Austria
,
France
,
Portugal
and
the
United
Kingdom
.
A
manpower
resources
'
plan
summarised
the
personnel
requirements
by
skill
category
and
headcount
,
together
with
the
required
training
programme
.
The
financial
plan
showed
the
investment
impact
on
sales
,
profit
and
return
on
investment
per
year
over
the
next
ten
years
,
while
the
financing
plan
described
how
the
investment
was
to
be
financed
:
namely
,
from
borrowings
in
the
early
years
until
the
plan
became
self-financing
from
funds
accrued
from
current
operations
,
in
year
four
.
The
forty-five
minute
presentation
concluded
with
a
summary
of
the
overall
effect
of
the
Plan
on
total
European
operations
.
It
appeared
to
roll
forward
and
unfold
under
its
own
natural
momentum
,
to
reach
its
clearly
defined
objectives
.
It
came
across
to
Cocello
and
the
committee
in
such
a
way
that
the
presenter
could
n't
help
but
benefit
from
being
associated
with
it
.
Klepner
stepped
down
from
the
podium
and
waited
for
questions
and
observations
.
"
Fine
plan
you
have
there
,
Pat
,
"
said
the
President
approvingly
.
"
I
like
it
.
"
Turning
toward
Klepner
he
nodded
his
approval
.
"
Excellent
presentation
,
Fred
.
Obviously
a
lot
of
thought
has
gone
into
the
plan
.
It
's
good
.
Fine
job
.
"
Klepner
kept
a
straight
face
,
but
was
overjoyed
at
the
top
man
's
response
.
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
"
Randy
Mueller
put
the
first
question
but
,
before
doing
so
,
added
his
congratulations
to
those
of
the
President
.
"
Good
show
,
Fred
.
You
've
done
a
fine
job
over
here
,
"
he
said
,
omnisciently
,
with
the
air
of
a
superior
conferring
praise
on
a
subordinate
.
"
Would
you
care
to
explain
to
the
committee
why
you
are
considering
the
UK
in
your
short
list
of
countries
to
be
considered
for
the
new
investment
proposals
.
I
thought
we
'd
all
agreed
at
previous
meetings
that
,
with
minor
exceptions
,
all
the
major
new
plants
would
be
located
on
the
continent
?
"
The
question
was
simply
a
put-up
job
,
Mueller
having
previously
primed
both
Klepner
and
Muldoon
.
The
question
was
designed
to
give
Klepner
the
opportunity
to
express
a
contrary
view
to
Sanders
,
which
,
in
effect
,
was
that
there
should
be
no
further
new
investment
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
"
We
've
included
the
UK
on
the
short
list
,
at
this
stage
,
"
said
Klepner
,
"
because
Mark
says
that
when
the
task
force
teams
come
to
prepare
the
comparative
cost
studies
in
detail
they
will
find
that
the
economics
of
manufacturing
certain
new
products
will
almost
certainly
favour
production
in
the
UK
.
Mark
takes
the
view
that
if
the
UK
is
not
to
be
considered
for
other
than
economic
reasons
,
then
that
's
a
matter
for
the
committee
and
the
Corporation
to
decide
.
But
he
wants
all
the
facts
to
be
presented
to
the
committee
before
a
corporate
decision
is
made
not
to
invest
in
the
UK
.
"
What
do
you
,
personally
,
think
about
that
approach
,
Fred
?
"
Mueller
asked
.
"
Well
,
I
guess
I
agree
with
the
committee
's
original
view
that
we
should
not
put
any
major
new
investment
in
the
UK
,
"
Klepner
replied
,
knowing
full
well
that
this
line
would
be
supported
by
Mueller
and
most
of
the
Americans
around
the
table
.
Mueller
turned
to
Muldoon
.
"
What
do
you
think
,
Pat
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Muldoon
coughed
nervously
"
I
tend
to
agree
with
Fred
,
"
he
replied
.
Mueller
then
turned
to
the
American
Managing
Director
in
charge
of
the
British
Components
'
Division
,
who
was
due
for
another
assignment
after
nearly
two
years
in
the
UK
.
He
too
knew
the
score
.
"
What
do
you
think
,
Hal
?
"
asked
Mueller
.
"
Waal
,
based
on
the
UK
track
record
in
recent
years
,
I
guess
I
got
ta
go
along
with
Pat
and
Fred
,
"
he
replied
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
.
Cocello
had
listened
without
interruption
.
He
addressed
Muldoon
.
"
Let
me
get
this
straight
,
Pat
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
.
"
You
got
ta
European
plan
which
includes
certain
major
new
investment
proposals
in
the
UK
subject
to
detailed
economic
justification
by
the
special
task
force
teams
.
But
you
and
Fred
and
Hal
do
n't
go
along
with
UK
investment
.
Is
that
right
?
Is
that
what
you
're
sayin'

"
Muldoon
shuffled
his
papers
nervously
.
"
Waal
,
I
guess
I
am
and
I
ai
n't

he
replied
.
"
What
the
hell
does
that
mean

"
asked
Cocello
irritably
.
Muldoon
looked
to
Mueller
for
support

Waal

'm
all

stuttered

's
a
good
one
,
a
damned
good
one
.
But
I
also
agree
with
Randy
here
,
and
with
Fred
and
Hal
,
that
I
'm
not
so
sure
about
the
UK
side
of
the
plan
.
"
"
The
President
grunted
and
turned
his
attention
to
McGillicuddy
.
"
Sounds
to
me
,
Clancy
,
that
you
European
guys
ai
n't
quite
made
up
your
minds
about
the
UK
,
"
he
said
.
Turning
to
Don
Peters
,
he
added
,
"
How
about
you
,
Don
?
They
tell
me
that
your
proposals
tomorrow
will
show
the
UK
coming
good
-
is
that
right
?
"
Don
Peters
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
.
"
That
's
right
,
Nate
,
"
he
replied
confidently
.
"
You
'll
hear
our
proposals
tomorrow
but
we
are
now
beginning
to
see
real
signs
of
a
big
improvement
at
our
UK
vehicle
plants
.
All
the
indications
are
that
we
are
now
forging
ahead
.
We
think
that
the
UK
is
bullish
in
the
years
ahead
and
we
are
backing
our
judgement
with
further
investment
proposals
.
"
Several
Americans
around
the
long
table
,
including
Mueller
and
the
head
of
the
British
Components
division
,
were
shaking
their
heads
slowly
.
Peters
saw
their
reactions
and
knew
instinctively
that
he
was
going
to
have
one
hell
of
a
fight
on
his
hands
the
next
day
to
convince
the
committee
of
his
vehicle
division
proposals
.
Fred
Clasper
's
disruptive
plan
had
been
well
prepared
.
In
addition
to
the
work
of
a
small
but
dedicated
group
of
left
wing
militants
who
held
shop
stewardships
at
the
Merseyside
plant
,
he
had
received
expert
academic
advice
from
two
university
lecturers
who
were
sympathetic
to
the
Communist
international
cause
.
One
was
a
lecturer
at
Oxford
,
the
other
at
Liverpool
University
.
Like
all
such
schemes
prepared
by
left-wing
militants
,
this
plan
was
aimed
at
putting
the
company
in
a
"
Catch
22
"
situation
.
Namely
,
whatever
action
the
company
took
,
it
would
be
blamed
for
the
ensuing
conflict
.
To
this
end
,
one
of
the
younger
Communist
shop
stewards
in
the
plot
had
agreed
to
be
the
fall
guy
.
It
was
not
a
particularly
difficult
decision
for
him
to
come
to
,
since
he
was
going
to
emigrate
to
Australia
anyway
.
Company
rules
stated
that
,
before
a
person
could
be
dismissed
for
misconduct
,
two
previous
warning
notes
had
to
be
formally
given
to
the
offender
,
placing
on
record
the
gravity
of
the
offence
.
Dismissal
following
automatically
if
a
third
serious
offence
was
committed
.
The
young
Communist
shop
steward
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
first
two
warning
notes
.
He
had
switched-off
the
assembly
track
one
Friday
afternoon
,
half
an
hour
before
finishing
time
,
ostensibly
on
the
grounds
that
the
overhead
conveyor
was
unsafe
and
a
danger
to
line
operators
working
below
.
The
foreman
had
naturally
hit
the
roof
over
the
loss
of
thirty
minutes
'
production
,
which
would
pull
down
his
departmental
output
and
efficiency
target
and
had
roundly
reprimanded
the
shop
steward
for
taking
such
unauthorised
action
without
first
bringing
the
alleged
safety
hazard
to
his
attention
,
in
line
with
normal
company
standard
practice
.
There
was
,
of
course
,
no
such
safety
problem
,
as
the
safety
inspector
subsequently
confirmed
,
and
the
steward
was
given
the
first
of
the
warning
notes
,
as
planned
.
He
obtained
the
second
by
pretending
to
trip
over
an
unseen
obstacle
,
which
inadvertently
threw
him
against
the
foreman
,
knocking
him
to
the
ground
and
depositing
his
daily
schedule
papers
all
over
the
floor
.
Both
men
had
leapt
to
their
feet
and
had
been
restrained
from
using
violence
by
the
mates
of
the
shop
steward
,
who
just
happened
to
be
on
hand
.
One
of
the
two
witnesses
,
who
also
just
happened
to
be
the
convener
,
Fred
Clasper
,
claimed
that
a
second
warning
note
was
unjustified
as
the
foreman
had
been
knocked
down
unintentionally
.
Nevertheless
,
as
planned
,
a
second
warning
note
was
issued
.
After
both
incidents
,
Clasper
had
made
it
known
,
throughout
the
plant
,
that
the
young
shop
steward
was
being
victimised
and
harassed
by
the
foreman
while
on
legitimate
union
business
.
It
was
alleged
by
Clasper
that
the
foreman
had
his
knife
in
the
young
kid
who
was
only
doing
his
job
.
"
The
foreman
is
out
to
get
him
"
was
the
expression
making
the
departmental
rounds
.
Clasper
and
the
conspirators
timed
the
third
offence
to
coincide
with
the
visit
to
the
UK
of
the
President
and
Chief
Executive
Officer
of
United
Motors
,
Nate
Cocello
,
as
this
would
provide
maximum
publicity
to
the
planned
strike
.
An
attempt
would
then
be
made
to
drag
Cocello
into
the
dispute
by
Clasper
making
a
public
appeal
to
the
President
to
reinstate
the
sacked
shop
steward
over
the
heads
of
plant
and
divisional
management
.
Either
way
,
Clasper
would
win
.
The
strike
would
once
again
demonstrate
the
power
of
the
unions
and
would
also
restore
Clasper
's
own
flagging
personal
influence
and
power
over
the
workers
.
While
Don
Peters
was
on
his
feet
on
the
second
day
of
the
meeting
of
the
European
Planning
Committee
,
explaining
his
plan
to
rejuvenate
the
ailing
British
vehicle
division
,
Fred
Clasper
was
also
on
his
feet
setting
in
motion
his
scheme
to
put
the
final
nail
in
its
coffin
.
Don
Peters
knew
when
he
went
to
the
podium
that
the
odds
were
stacked
heavily
against
him
gaining
the
support
of
Nate
Cocello
and
the
committee
.
The
American
's
performance
at
the
podium
was
masterly
.
He
began
by
saying
that
with
the
UK
vehicle
division
's
track
record
over
recent
years
,
he
could
n't
really
expect
to
receive
any
support
to
the
plan
he
was
about
to
describe
.
He
then
went
on
to
identify
each
and
every
major
problem
which
affected
cost
and
profit
performance
,
quantifying
each
problem
area
and
finally
consolidating
the
total
cost
penalty
at
no
less
than
four
hundred
million
dollars
.
He
then
described
his
proposals
to
reduce
that
cost
penalty
and
turn
the
division
from
an
operating
loss
into
a
satisfactory
profit
and
return
on
investment
.
Finally
,
he
threw
up
slides
showing
the
improvements
which
had
already
been
achieved
over
the
last
three
months
.
What
came
across
to
Nate
and
the
committee
,
most
of
all
,
was
Peters
the
leader
.
He
had
been
given
a
tough
assignment
and
he
was
in
there
fighting
like
hell
on
behalf
of
the
British
vehicle
division
.
He
gave
credit
to
local
management
and
to
the
unions
,
singling
out
the
name
of
Clem
Bunker
for
most
of
the
industrial
relations
improvements
coming
through
.
He
ended
his
hour-long
presentation
with
the
words
,
"
We
are
on
our
way
toward
making
the
division
one
of
the
best
goddamned
outfits
in
overseas
operations
,
and
I
just
want
to
be
given
the
chance
to
prove
that
the
plan
which
I
have
outlined
to
you
today
is
the
right
one
for
the
British
operation
,
for
Europe
and
for
the
Corporation
.
"
Even
Americans
round
the
table
,
who
did
n't
give
him
a
snowball
in
hell
's
chance
of
getting
approval
to
his
plan
,
had
to
admit
that
he
was
still
in
there
,
fighting
like
a
demon
for
a
lost
cause
.
He
handled
the
many
questions
in
masterly
fashion
,
particularly
the
probing
questions
from
Cocello
.
He
was
in
the
hot
seat
for
more
than
three
hours
.
He
had
gone
to
the
podium
at
eight
o
"
clock
.
By
noon
he
had
obtained
Nate
's
approval
and
had
won
the
day
.
The
Merseyside
convener
was
aware
that
President
Nate
Cocello
was
coming
to
the
UK
for
talks
with
British
and
European
management
.
The
grapevine
always
flashed
advance
notice
of
such
events
,
though
it
was
never
hard
to
guess
when
a
VIP
visit
was
imminent
because
of
the
frenzied
housekeeping
activity
at
each
plant
which
always
preceded
it
.
Clasper
saw
Cocello
's
arrival
at
Heathrow
on
television
.
When
asked
by
an
interviewer
if
he
was
pleased
with
the
performance
of
the
British
plants
,
the
President
had
replied
that
although
past
performance
had
been
bad
by
traditional
British
standards
,
he
was
now
happy
to
say
that
in
recent
months
a
marked
improvement
had
taken
place
.
This
enabled
him
to
look
forward
with
confidence
to
continued
improvements
which
would
put
the
British
plants
back
at
the
top
of
the
performance
league
,
where
they
used
to
be
,
and
where
they
belonged
.
Clasper
had
other
ideas
,
however
.
On
the
day
that
Don
Peters
was
on
his
feet
at
the
EPC
meeting
,
fighting
for
the
survival
of
the
British
Vehicle
Division
and
the
jobs
of
the
fifty
thousand
people
it
employed
,
Fred
Clasper
was
setting
in
motion
the
third
and
final
stage
of
his
scheme
to
sabotage
any
possible
chance
of
the
company
's
recovery
.
It
had
been
arranged
by
the
conspirators
that
the
young
shop
steward
,
who
had
already
collected
two
warning
notes
as
planned
,
would
take
out
a
set
of
spark
plugs
in
his
lunch
box
at
the
mid-day
break
.
One
of
the
conspirators
would
ring
the
foreman
to
tip
him
off
that
the
shop
steward
could
be
caught
red-handed
stealing
company
property
if
they
searched
him
at
the
gate
.
The
foreman
would
naturally
advise
the
security
men
on
the
gate
,
and
Personnel
Department
,
which
would
result
in
the
steward
being
apprehended
and
instantly
dismissed
.
He
would
plead
that
the
plugs
had
been
planted
by
someone
who
bore
a
grudge
against
him
,
and
the
story
would
be
quickly
put
round
the
plant
that
it
was
the
foreman
himself
who
had
fixed
it
,
to
settle
an
old
score
.
Credibility
would
be
given
to
the
shop
steward
's
story
by
having
his
lunch
box
placed
in
an
unauthorised
position
on
the
assembly
track
from
which
the
foreman
would
have
to
remove
it
,
and
be
seen
doing
so
.
Everything
went
according
to
plan
and
at
noon
the
steward
was
stopped
at
the
gate
.
The
spark
plugs
were
found
in
the
lunch
box
as
arranged
and
he
was
immediately
dismissed
in
accordance
with
company
practice
.
In
itself
,
the
offence
justified
instant
dismissal
under
company
rules
.
The
two
previous
warnings
received
by
the
steward
made
it
inevitable
.
Clasper
was
present
in
the
Personnel
Manager
s
office
when
the
offence
was
read
and
the
dismissal
notice
formally
handed
out
.
That
afternoon
the
convener
communicated
his
version
of
the
story
to
the
shop
steward
's
committee
and
within
an
hour
every
department
was
buzzing
with
the
news
.
It
was
well
known
that
the
foreman
and
the
shop
steward
in
question
were
always
in
dispute
,
and
it
appeared
to
the
majority
that
the
foreman
had
,
in
fact
,
set
him
up
to
get
rid
of
him
and
to
settle
an
old
account
.
Production
was
severely
disrupted
in
all
departments
during
the
afternoon
as
the
shop
stewards
spread
the
message
.
At
four
o'clock
they
fed
back
the
feelings
of
the
workers
to
the
convener
,
and
at
five
minutes
past
four
,
Clasper
took
the
giant
plant
out
on
strike
,
advising
the
Personnel
and
Plant
Managers
that
they
would
n't
return
until
the
sacked
shop
steward
had
been
re-instated
.
The
majority
had
no
wish
to
stop
work
,
particularly
after
the
great
strides
which
had
been
made
in
recent
months
,
but
they
were
n't
going
to
be
sat
on
either
.
To
them
it
sounded
like
a
straight
forward
case
of
victimisation
by
the
foreman
.
The
message
that
the
big
Merseyside
plant
was
out
on
strike
was
conveyed
to
Don
Peters
at
the
EPC
meeting
.
One
of
the
secretaries
entered
the
conference
room
with
a
message
to
ring
the
Plant
Manager
urgently
.
"
The
plant
has
stopped
work
,
"
she
added
.
The
pain
on
the
American
's
face
was
clear
for
all
to
see
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
left
the
meeting
to
make
the
call
.
On
his
return
,
he
immediately
communicated
the
bad
news
to
his
boss
,
Clancy
McGillicuddy
,
and
to
Nate
Cocello
,
by
handing
them
a
copy
of
the
statement
put
out
by
the
Plant
Manager
.
Nate
closed
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
in
disbelief
.
Clancy
McGillicuddy
was
furious
.
What
in
God
's
name
had
happened
to
the
British
?
Peters
nodded
his
agreement
.
"
Yeah

he
sighed

The
President
shook
his
head

Peters
sighed
again

that

the
plan
is
a
good
one

it
would
work
,
if
only
they
'd
give
it
a

All
the
infectious
enthusiasm

gone
out

Sure

the

man
replied
.
"
So
we
'll
have

'll

From
here
on
in
,
we
go
back

original
plan

phase-out

the

replied
the
European
General
Director
.
After
dinner
that
evening
,
Cocello
instructed
Randy
Mueller
to
set
up
a
task
force
team
from
Detroit
to
come
up
with
a
phase-out

Mueller
readily
.
"
Today

Cocello
nodded
sadly
.
As
an
afterthought
,
Mueller
added
,
"
What
about
the
Components
"
Plan
?
Do
we
go
ahead
with
the
UK
side
of
that
?

do
we
phase
that
out
,
too
?
"
He
hurried
on
.
"
Guess
we
should
be
consistent
,
should
n't
we
?
We
can
hardly
tell
the
Finance
and
Executive
Committee
that
the
British
are
unreliable
at
the
vehicle
plants
,
but
as
solid
as
the
Rock
of
Gibraltar
when
it
comes
to
components

"
"
No
,
we
ca

Cocello
agreed

for
some
totally
inexplicable
reason

be
the
truth

you

Randy

The

necessary
changes

Mueller
immediately
saw
his
opportunity

the

the
vehicle

he
asked
.
"

"
"

you

right

said
the
top
man
.
"

you
should
take
both

control
them
from
Detroit

that
means
that
we
can
do
it
our
way

Sanders
ca
n't
be
all
that
interested
in
the
Plan
if
he
takes
a
few
days
vacation
rather
than
give
the
presentation
.
Jeez
,
that
amazes
me
,
as
well
as
riles
me.
"
he
added
,
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
.
"
What
makes
a
guy
like
that
behave
that
way
?
I
just
do
n't
understand
it
.
"
Mueller
never
turned
a
hair
,
or
felt
a
twinge
of
remorse
.
As
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
he
had
just
knocked
another
competitor
out
of
the
promotion
stakes
.
"
It
's

be
right

replied
enthusiastically
.

can
really

overseas
"
operations
effectively
,
until
we
get
full
planning

from
Detroit

The
European
operation
is
too
damned
big
a
slice
of
the
corporate
business
to
be
left
to
the
locals
.
Today
's
events

confirm
what
we

been

.
"
The
President
and
Chief
Executive
officer
gazed
into
his
Scotch
.
He
was
still
uneasy
about
Mueller
.
He
remembered
what
he
had
put
on
his
personal
qualities
'
file
:
"
Judgement
not
always
reliable
in
the
political
and
commercial
area
"
.
He
looked
long
and
hard
at
the
younger
executive
as
if
trying
to
sum
him
up
.
"
OK
,
Randy
,
"
he
said
after
a
long
pause
.
"
Go
ahead

The
Committee
agreed
in
principle
to
your
initial
proposals

Not
unanimously

you

the
majority

up

detailed
proposal
for
consideration

back
,

we
'll
see

they
buy
the
specifics

"
That
same
evening
Mark
Sanders
was
dining
alone
in
Istanbul
after
a
satisfactory
series
of
meetings
with
the
local
Managing
Director
and
the
Turkish
Minister
of
Economic
Affairs
.
He
had
declined
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
as
the
stabbing
pains
in
his
head
had
been
getting
steadily
worse
throughout
the
day
.
They
were
now
blindingly
bad
.
He
placed
his
unfinished
cigar
in
the
ash
tray
and
rose
from
the
table
,
leaving
his
brandy
untouched
.
He
had
decided
to
go
to
bed
early
.
After
lying
in
a
hot
bath
for
an
unusually
long
time
,
he
stretched
out
on
the
bed
,
eyes
closed
,
hoping
that
the
pains
would
go
away
.
But
he
could
n't
get
the
thought
out
of
his
head
that
in
London
,
that
very
day
,
Muldoon
and
Klepner
had
given
HIS
Ten
Year
Plan
to
Cocello
.
The
more
he
thought
of
the
two
carpet-baggers
standing
up
at
the
podium
,
the
more
intense
the
pains
in
his
head
became
.
He
put
a
hand
to
his
forehead
to
ease
the
pressure
.
Nate
could
n't
possibly
have
believed
that
the
Turkish
problem
was
more
important
than
the
European
Plan
.
Not
in
a
million
years
.
In
which
case
the
reason
was
blindingly
obvious
.
Muldoon
had
more
than
hinted
at
what
was
happening
.
Detroit
was
paving
the
way
for
Mueller
to
take
over
and
run
the
whole
bloody
show
from
America
.
That
's
what
he
had
always
wanted
to
do
,
and
Klepner
was
his
advance
guard
.
His
mole
.
His
trained
pet
poodle
who
had
been
sent
to
Europe
to
reconnoitre
the
scene
and
steal
Mark
's
clothes
.
He
would
then
take
over
the
European
Components
'
planning
activity
when
everything
was
centralised
in
Detroit
.
He
thumped
his
pillow
with
his
fist
.
The
bastards
are
at
it
again
,
he
said
to
himself
,
vividly
recalling
the
Steiner
incident
in
New
York
.
Only
this
time
it
's
curtains
.
He
was
finished
.
This
had
got
to
be
the
end
of
the
road
.
He
stared
at
the
ceiling
.
How
would
he
and
Georgina
change
their
lifestyle
after
all
those
years
as
a
corporate
executive
?
How
would
they
live
?
What
would
happen
when
the
monthly
cheque
was
no
longer
paid
into
the
bank
?
What
about
the
mortgage
and
the
school
fees
?
They
go
on
for
ever
.
Well
,
until
sixty-five
,
and
that
's
a
hell
of
a
long
way
away
.
What
would
they
do
in
the
interim
?
They
'd
have
to
move
to
a
smaller
house
,
that
's
for
sure
.
My
God
,
how
would
he
tell
Georgina
?
It
would
break
her
heart
to
leave
the
lovely
old
stone
barn
in
Buckinghamshire
.
How
could
he
keep
Andrew
at
Agricultural
college
?
Well
they
would
,
somehow
or
other
.
They
'd
done
it
for
Adam
and
Christopher
and
they
'd
do
it
for
him
.
But
how
would
he
break
the
news
to
Georgina
that
he
'd
let
her
down
after
all
these
years
?
He
fell
asleep
,
but
the
pains
in
his
head
were
still
there
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
.
Clem
Bunker
was
in
a
rare-rage
.
He
had
completely
lost
his
temper
when
he
had
heard
the
news
that
Clasper
had
taken
the
giant
Merseyside
plant
out
on
strike
.
Bunker
had
received
the
message
from
a
convener
at
one
of
the
Midlands
plants
,
who
was
also
hopping
mad
.
And
so
,
he
said
,
were
all
the
shop
stewards
at
his
plant
,
who
were
expressing
the
view
that
,
once
again
,
the
Merseysiders
were
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands
,
breaking
national
agreements
and
overturning
official
union
policy
.
The
Midlands
'
shop
stewards
knew
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
the
strike
affected
supplies
to
their
own
plants
and
those
in
the
South
,
jeopardising
the
recovery
plan
which
had
been
producing
such
vast
improvements
in
performance
.
Morale
had
been
at
its
highest
for
years
,
up
to
the
moment
that
the
news
had
reached
them
that
Merseyside
was
out
.
"
Clasper
's
behind
this
!
"
Bunker
was
furious
.
"
He
was
dead
against
the
plan
and
now
he
's
doing
his
damnedest
to
wreck
it
.
"
"
That
's
what
everyone
round
here
is
saying
as
well
,
"
the
convener
agreed
.
"
It
's
his
Commie
mate
who
got
the
chop
.
And
nobody
believes
Clasper
's
version
of
the
story
.
It
's
all
too
bloody
coincidental
.
"
"
Is
that
really
the
majority
view
at
your
plant
?
"
"
Well
,
it
's
not
often

majority

themselves
without
some
prompting
from
the
shop
stewards
,
"
the
convener
replied
,
"
but
in
this
instance
the
reaction
was
instantaneous
.
We
heard
the
news
over
the
radio
at
lunch
break
and
I
tell
you

Clem

up

sacking

all
know

's

the
hell

.
"
Loud

replied
the
convener
.
"
They
are
sick
to
the
eyeballs

bloody
political
conscience

A
hell
of
a
roar
went
up
in
the
canteen
at
lunch
break
when
one
of
the
shop
stewards
said

on

on

of
the
workers

every
bloody
one

them
had
lost
their

That
's
what
my
lads
think
about

bloody
Clasper

question
is

accurate
reading

either
way

Initially
,
I
want
the
gut
feel
of
the
members
.
We
can
take
final
readings
and
decide
on
an
official
union
line
when
we
know
all
the
facts

I
'm
going

other

do
the

That
evening
,
Bunker
phoned
Peters
at
The
Inn
on
the
Park
to
tell
him
that
he
had
called
an
emergency
meeting
of
plant
conveners
to
help
resolve
the
Merseyside
problem
.
He
was
dismayed
by
the
American
's
response
.
There
was
more
than
a
hint
of
weary
resignation
in
his
reply
.
All
the
old
fighting
spirit
and
enthusiasm
had
gone
.
"
Yeah
.
OK
Clem
.
Thanks
for
ringing
.
and
thanks
for
all
the
effort
that
you
have
put
in
personally
.
Just
sorry
it
has
turned
out
this
way
.
"
He
sounded
like
a
beaten
man
.
News
of
the
strike
made
headlines
in
all
the
British
newspapers
.
It
was
also
given
in-depth
coverage
on
television
and
radio
that
evening
,
with
News
at
Ten
running
it
as
the
lead
story
in
the
first
half
of
the
programme
and
coming
back
to
it
again
in
the
second
.
Clasper
was
interviewed
outside
the
giant
Merseyside
plant
and
predictably
blamed
management
for
deliberately
provoking
the
strike
.
"
Are
you
really
saying
that
the
company
is
to
blame
for
the
strike
?
"
the
man
with
the
microphone
asked
,
thrusting
it
under
Clasper
's
chin
.
"
Well
you
do
n't
think
my
lads
would
be
out
here
just
for
the
bloody
exercise
,
do
you
?
"
Clasper
demanded
sarcastically
.
"
Course
they
're
to
blame
.
Stands
to
reason
.
And
my
lads
are
staying
out
until
Management
reinstates
the
innocent
victim
.
"
And
is
that
the
only
thing
which
would
influence
you
to
call
off
this
strike
,
which
is
obviously
doing
great
harm
to
the
company
and
the
country
?
"
the
interviewer
asked
.
"
Nothing
more
and
nothing
less
,
"
replied
Clasper
.
"
I
'm
already
havin'
to
ask
the
lads
to
exercise
great
restraint
over
this
particular
issue
.
They
want
me
to
insist
that
the
company
sacks
the
foreman
before
they
go
back
,
but
I
've
told
'em
I
wo
n't
be
a
party
to
victimisation
either
way
.
"
"
Thank
you
,
Mr
Clasper
,
"
said
the
interviewer
.
"
Now
back
to
the
studio
.
"
And
there
the
newsreader
told
the
British
people
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
obtain
an
interview
with
the
local
Plant
Manager
,
who
had
declined
to
comment
.
The
President
of
United
Motors
-
who
was
in
London
at
that
moment
-
had
also
declined
to
comment
on
a
local
issue
which
,
he
had
said
was
a
matter
for
local
management
.
The
inference
viewers
gained
was
that
management
was
to
blame
in
one
way
or
another
.
When
he
returned
to
the
States
,
Mueller
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
Cocello
's
instructions
to
direct
the
phase-out
of
UK
vehicle
operations
from
Detroit
,
and
to
prepare
detail
plans
to
centralise
European
and
world
planning
activities
.
His
first
step
was
to
request
that
all
copies
of
the
European
Vehicle
and
Components
"
Plan
be
withdrawn
from
circulation
.
Having
thus
effectively
stopped
the
Plans
dead
in
their
tracks
,
he
then
proceeded
,
in
the
name
of
the
President
,
to
dry
up
the
outward
flow
of
all
planning
information
from
Detroit
,
so
that
,
from
that
moment
on
,
only
he
and
members
of
the
world
planning
group
would
be
aware
of
what
was
going
on
,
worldwide
,
at
the
planning
stage
.
Mueller
thus
gained
immediate
planning
control
of
world
wide
operations
,
even
before
he
had
formally
received
top
management
approval
to
proceed
.
The
President
had
given
Mueller
an
inch
,
but
he
had
already
taken
a
mile
.
This
tactic
was
not
unusual
in
the
Corporation
.
Mueller
had
simply
used
his
privileged
position
to
advise
the
General
Directors
that
he
was
operating
on
the
instructions
of
the
President
.
He
would
use
that
authority
to
his
own
personal
advantage
.
Mark
Sanders
returned
from
Istanbul
feeling
exhausted
,
depressed
and
ill
.
The
blinding
headaches
he
had
been
experiencing
in
recent
weeks
were
taking
their
toll
,
and
he
looked
grey
and
drawn
when
he
arrived
home
.
Lately
,
Georgina
had
been
worried
by
the
general
deterioration
in
his
appearance
.
But
now
she
was
visibly
shocked
by
the
drained
and
haggard-looking
face
which
kissed
her
.
She
wanted
to
say
,
"
You
look
awful
,
darling
,
"
but
decided
against
it
.
"
What
kind
of
a
trip
have
you
had
?
"
she
asked
instead
.
"
Oh
,
not
too
bad
,
"
he
replied
wearily
.
She
took
his
suitcase
and
placed
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
.
"
Come
into
the
kitchen
,
and
we
will
have
a
cup
of
tea
.
I
've
so
much
news
to
tell
you
.
All
sorts
of
things
seem
to
have
happened
while
you
have
been
away
this
time

"
Mark
smiled
thinly
and
kissed
her
affectionately
on
the
cheek
.
"
Tell
me
about
it
,
"
he
replied
.
"
I
could
do
with
a
good
laugh
.
"
"
Why
darling
?
What
's
the
matter
?
Trouble
at
t'mill
?
"
Mark
slipped
an
arm
around
her
slim
waist
as
they
walked
from
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
.
"
Perhaps
it
's
old
Montezuma
's
revenge
,
"
he
replied
.
"
Must
be
getting
too
old
for
this
globe-trotting
lark
,
or
else
my
mis-spent
youth
is
catching
up
on
me
.
I
'm
rapidly
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
young
man
's
game
.
"
"
Nonsense
,
Mark
.
You
're
still
a
young
man
-
well
,
youngish.
"
she
said
,
trying
to
tease
him
out
of
his
apparent
lethargy
and
depression
.
"
Let's
have
that
cup
of
tea
and
you
'll
feel
better
.
"
"
Ah
,
fill
the
cup
,
what
boots
it
to
repeat
,
how
time
is
slipping
underneath
our
feet
,
"
he
quoted
with
a
sigh
.
"
Oh
darling
.
What
a
sad
sack
we
are
today
.
Is
that
how
you
feel
?
Shall
I
accompany
you
on
the
violin
?
Now
let
me
tell
you
all
the
news

"
She
poured
the
tea
.
"
Christopher
has
been
promoted
after
only
one
year
.
The
Chairman
of
the
company
told
him
he
was
most
impressed
with
the
contribution
he
's
made
to
the
business
,
and
that
he
could
go
right
to
the
top
if
he
keeps
it
up
.
I
knew
you
'd
be
delighted
to
hear
that
.

She
sipped
her
tea
.
"

've
found
a
super
husband
for
Harriet

Champion
of

last
year

Lives

Absolutely

said
Mark
.
"
What
else
?
Ah
yes
;
a
Secretary
at
the
Ministry
of
Industry
wants
you
to
ring
him
.
Seems
they
want
you
to
address
the
European
Commission
on
European
industrial
development
.
In
Dublin
,
I
think
she
said
.
Something
about
the
factors
which
influence
multi-nat
location
decisions
.
Anyway
,
you
'll
know
what
it
means
when
you
see
it
.
I
've
written
it
all
down
.
Oh
and
yes
-
a
chap
from
Conservative
Central
Office
rang
up
to
say
they
'd
like
to
know
if
you
would
be
prepared
to
stand
for
the
European
Parliament
.
He
sounded
somewhat
to
the
right
of
Genghis
Khan
.
I
said
I
did
n't
think
so
,
as
you
were
rather
busy
,
but
I
'd
pass
the
message
on
.
Hope
I
did
the
right
thing
.
I
said
you
never
knew
where
you
were
from
one
week
to
the
next
.
He
said
that
would
do
nicely
.
Just
like
the
American
Express
advertisement
.
Perfect
credentials
apparently
,
for
European
parliamentarians
.
"
Now
what
next
?
The
Chicheley-Smythes
have
bought
an
absolutely
super
villa
in
Sardinia
and
say
we
could
rent
it
if
we
'd
like
to
.
I
've
seen
the
photographs
.
Gorgeous
location
overlooking
a
quiet
bay
.
It
sleeps
ten
with
a
permanent
staff
of
three
.
Only
a
thousand
pounds
a
week
,
yacht
included
.
I
'd
love
that
for
two
or
three
weeks
,
would
n't
you
?
"
"
We
would
n't
want

ourselves

Mark
said
facetiously
,
"
four

five

should
think

"
"
And
we
could
take
the

'd

we
can
talk
about
that
later

I
've
decided

up

the
urge

She
gave
him
a
beautiful
smile
,

lit
her
lovely
face
.
"
Well

how
's
that
for

she
asked

expression
before

there
more

Now
let
me
see
.
Ah

yes

Andrew
's
coming
home
for
the
weekend
so
I
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
drinks
party
.
I
've
invited
the
Bunkers
,

that
's
all
right

I

Clem

Gwen

the
girls

be
nicer
company

Andrew

"
Fine

agreed
Mark
without
much
enthusiasm
.
"
If
Clem
can
make
it
,
that
is

I
heard
about
this
latest
Merseyside
strike
in
Istanbul

finish
off

UK
vehicle
division

he
said
forlornly
,

Don
Peters

he
added
,
shaking
his
head

Some
of
the
stupid
bastards
wo
n't
be
satisfied
until
we
no
longer
make
a
single
vehicle
in
the
UK
.
Then
I
suppose
they
'll
say
it
's
all
management
's
fault
,
and
people
will
believe
them
.
And
who
the
hell
IS
management
?

he
demanded
,
his
voice
rising
.
"
People
like
me
,
who
've
worked
their
guts
out
to
expand
the
business

militant
bastards
have
been
working
their
guts
out

it

Georgina
was
nodding
agreement
.
She
patted
his
wrist
.
"
I
'm
quite
sure
you
're
right

But
we
were
n't
talking
about
the
motor
industry
and
the
never-ending
management-union
saga

We
were
talking
about
Andrew
coming
home

the
weekend

having
the
Bunkers
round
for
drinks

I

Lying
in
bed
that
evening
,
they
talked
a
lot
about
their
life
together
.
They
recalled
their
first
days
.
The
county
ball
.
The
Paul
Jones
and
the
emotional
somersaults
when
the
music
stopped
and
they
came
face
to
face
for
the
very
first
time
.
The
wedding
.
The
birth
of
their
first
son
,
Adam
,
and
then
Christopher
and
Andrew
.
The
children
growing
up
with
all
the
laughter
and
tears
.
Schooldays
and
the
void
they
both
felt
when
the
boys
went
off
to
boarding
school
,
followed
by
the
joy
unconfined
when
they
came
home
at
the
end
of
term
.
Mark
's
promotions
and
progress
up
the
company
ladder
.
New
and
changing
homes
.
Friends
lost
and
friends
gained
.
Family
achievements
and
disappointments
.
Notwithstanding
current
problems
which
they
discussed
lightly
,
it
had
all
been
wonderful
.
They
fell
asleep
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
,
holding
hands
.
The
next
day
Mark
arrived
back
at
UM
's
European
headquarters
in
London
and
received
an
early
call
from
Muldoon
.
He
went
down
the
airless
corridor
to
his
Boss
's
office
,
said
hello
to
the
secretary
,
and
walked
into
the
large
oak-panelled
room
which
was
as
big
as
the
lobby
of
many
a
sizeable
hotel
.
Muldoon
rose
immediately
from
his
enormous
black
leather
chair
to
greet
him
,
coming
from
behind
the
vast
desk
with
hand
outstretched
.
"
Hello
Mark
.
Have
a
good
trip

"
He
took
the
Englishman
by
the
arm
and
ushered
him
toward
the
easy
chairs
arranged
around
a
long
rectangular
coffee
table
.
Instinctively
,
Mark
felt
uneasy
.
Why
the
hand
on
the
arm
and
the
over-friendly
approach
?
Muldoon
never
emerged
from
behind
his
desk
to
greet
colleagues
.
Only
visitors
and
VIPs
got
that
special
reception
.
Muldoon
poured
the
coffee
.
"

Planning
meeting
go

Mark
asked
him
.
"

was

he
added
.
"

Muldoon

somewhat
uneasy

asked

"
"

Mark
nodded

"
What
was
Mueller
doing
answering
questions

was
there
to

them

"
"

Muldoon
replied
quietly
.
"

that
mean

"
Muldoon
seemed
to
be
taking
a
long
time
over
his
coffee
.
He
evaded
Mark
's
eyes

down

increasing
nervousness

Mark
's

one

faked
incredulity

His
gut
feelings
had
been
right

he
scoffed

,

Nate
and
the
Executive
Committee
would
never
fall
for
that
bloody
empire-building
game
!
The
regions
are
far
too
big
and
complex
to
be
handled
from
Detroit
and
even
if
they
were
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
they
could
do
it
more
effectively

York
and
Detroit
will
come
up
with
an
attractive
separation
package
,
you
can
be
sure
of
that
.
They
've
already
told
me
you
'll
get
the
maximum
terms
permitted
under
British
law

"
The
two
men
rose
from
the
table
together
.
"
Sure
.
We
have
no
choice
in
the
matter

"
said
the
Englishman
.
"
There
has
to
be
losers
as
well
as
winners
,
,
said
the
American
.
"
I
guess
we
're
both
losers
,
Mark
.
"
The
Englishman
returned
to
his
own
palatial
office
and
sat
with
his
head
in
hands
.
Another
of
his
blinding
headaches
had
developed
and
he
felt
a
tight
sensation
in
his
chest
,
which
made
breathing
very
painful
and
difficult
.
His
secretary
entered
the
room
.
Can
I
get
you
a
coffee
,
Mr
Sanders
?
You
do
n't
look
at
all
well
.
Shall
I
get
the
doctor
?
"
He
looked
up
and
smiled
.
"
No
thank
you
Millie
.
I
'm
all
right
.
Just
a
headache
.
Be
OK
in
a
minute
.
Would
love
a
cup
of
coffee
though
.
"
Are
you
sure
I
should
n't
get
a
doctor
?
"
she
asked
.
"
No
thank
you
.
I
'll
be
OK
.
It
's
only
a
headache
.
"
Millie
had
her
reasons
for
being
concerned
.
The
petticoat
Mafia
at
the
top
of
the
organisation
always
knew
what
was
going
on
,
often
before
the
top
executives
themselves
.
Millie
and
the
secretaries
of
Pat
Muldoon
and
Clancy
McGillicuddy
were
all
close
friends
.
They
had
got
together
over
the
weekend
to
discuss
the
implications
of
the
confidential
letter
the
two
Americans
had
received
from
Randy
Mueller
on
behalf
of
Nate
Cocello
.
Major
changes
were
afoot
which
affected
their
respective
bosses
.
By
the
time
Mark
reached
home
that
evening
,
the
pains
in
his
head
were
excruciating
.
He
decided
against
telling
Georgina
about
his
meeting
with
Muldoon
.
He
would
wait
for
the
right
moment
.
This
was
n't
it
.
Mark
had
a
very
full
fortnight
ahead
,
for
which
he
was
grateful
.
It
gave
him
little
time
to
think
of
his
own
problems
.
First
,
there
was
a
meeting
in
Whitehall
of
the
Economic
Planning
Council
,
followed
by
the
conference
at
Trinity
College
Dublin
,
at
which
he
had
been
invited
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
European
investment
.
He
had
accepted
the
invitation
gladly
,
knowing
full
well
that
it
would
be
his
last
opportunity
to
speak
in
public
as
a
European
executive
of
United
Motors
.
He
hoped
to
make
it
a
fitting
swan-song
.
At
the
Economic
Planning
Council
he
had
expected
to
see
Clem
Bunker
,
but
he
was
absent
,
holding
his
own
meeting
with
the
vehicle
plant
conveners
in
an
attempt
to
determine
the
truth
about
the
sacking
incident
and
to
resolve
the
dispute
.
What
he
did
n't
know
,
could
n't
know
,
was
that
nothing
he
could
now
do
would
make
any
difference
.
There
had
been
trouble
on
Merseyside
just
once
too
often
,
and
muddleheaded
militants
who
believed
that
revolution
was
spawned
in
deprivation
and
poverty
would
be
able
to
hold
a
little
holiday
in
their
hearts
,
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
several
more
thousand
British
workers
had
been
gulled
into
inflicting
poverty
and
deprivation
upon
themselves
.
Opening
the
meeting
of
the
Economic
Planning
Council
,
the
Chairman
,
Lord
Hampshire
,
surprised
members
by
announcing
that
the
Prime
Minister
intended
to
sit
in
on
the
transport
debate
,
which
was
the
subject
of
a
White
Paper
about
to
be
discussed
on
the
floor
of
the
House
.
As
this
was
the
first
item
on
the
agenda
,
the
Prime
Minister
made
her
appearance
at
ten
thirty-three
,
immediately
after
the
Chairman
had
made
his
announcement
.
After
the
usual
preliminaries
and
courtesies
from
the
Chair
,
the
Minister
of
Transport
outlined
the
Government
's
proposals
before
the
Chairman
threw
the
subject
open
for
discussion
.
But
,
before
doing
so
,
he
asked
the
Prime
Minister
if
she
wished
to
say
a
few
words
.
The
"
Iron
Lady
"
as
she
was
called
,
smiled
the
steely
smile
which
was
so
familiar
on
the
television
screen
and
in
the
press
.
"
I
am
here
to
listen
and
learn
,
my
Lord
Chairman
,
"
she
said
in
her
clear
and
authoritative
voice
.
"
But
I
am
particularly
interested
to
know
if
the
United
Kingdom
incurs
a
significant
transportation
cost
penalty
on
its
exports
to
Europe
which
puts
this
country
at
a
commercial
and
economic
disadvantage
to
the
rest
of
the
Community
.
I
am
also
keen
to
know
,
"
she
continued
,
"
if
any
such
cost
penalties
operate
to
our
disadvantage
when
European
investment
decisions
are
made
,
in
particular
those
international
mobile
investment
decisions
which
are
made
by
the
multinationals
.
I
understand
that
Mr
Sanders
has
accepted
an
invitation
to
address
the
European
Commission
on
the
subject
in
Dublin
,
and
I
look
forward
to
hearing
his
observations
.
"
Lord
Hampshire
had
folded
a
piece
of
paper
which
was
being
passed
around
the
table
.
It
arrived
in
front
of
Mark
with
his
name
on
it
.
He
unfolded
the
paper
.
"
Do
n't
put
your
pads
on
,
just
yet
,
"
it
said
.
"
Want
you
to
come
in
lower
down
the
batting
order
.
"
It
was
signed
"
H
"
.
The
Chairman
of
the
National
Docks
'
Authority
opened
the
batting
by
reviewing
plans
to
meet
the
ever-growing
volume
of
docks
'
traffic
,
particularly
the
substantial
growth
in
roll-on
,
roll-off
between
Britain
and
the
continent
.
The
Chief
Highways
Planner
followed
,
outlining
the
Government
's
intentions
to
provide
further
motorway
links
between
industrial
centres
and
the
ports
.
He
also
described
the
various
channel
tunnel
options
currently
being
studied
by
the
Ministry
.
The
rail
,
airways
and
waterways
chiefs
then
outlined
their
plans
,
before
the
Chairman
threw
the
subject
open
to
the
Council
members
.
Several
members
then
questioned
the
planning
assumption
of
the
Chief
Planning
Officers
,
making
pertinent
observations
based
on
their
own
particular
knowledge
and
experience
.
Mark
Sanders
was
called
by
the
Chairman
after
an
hour
's
discussion
.
"
Now
let's
have
a
multi-national
view
point
,
"
he
said
cheerfully
.
"
Particularly
on
the
points
raised
by
the
Prime
Minister
.
Mark
would
you
like
to
face
the
next
ball
?
"
Mark
smiled
and
nodded
.
"
Before
we
begin
,
Mr
Sanders
,
"
the
Prime
Minister
said
,
warmly
,
"
will
you
tell
me
which
hat
you
will
be
wearing
today
?
Your
European
hat
,
or
the
British
one
?
"
she
smiled
a
thin
smile
.
The
Chairman
smiled
.
Mark
smiled
.
Everyone
smiled
.
"
Whichever
one
you
wish
me
to
wear
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
he
replied
.
"
Can
we
see
you
in
both
?
"
she
rejoined
.
"
Then
we
can
judge
which
one
we
prefer
.
"
"
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
look
particularly
good
in
either
,
"
Mark
said
,
"
but
,
putting
on
my
British
hat
first
:
yes
,
Prime
Minister
,
the
United
Kingdom
is
at
a
considerable
disadvantage
when
multi-nationals
consider
investment
locations
in
Europe
.
The
transport
cost
penalty
,
to
which
you
referred
,
varies
of
course
with
the
nature
of
the
product
being
manufactured
,
and
ranges
from
two
per
cent
to
twenty
per
cent
in
the
motor
industry
.
"
"
So
why
is
it
called
a
penalty
?
"
the
Prime
Minister
asked
.
"
That
's
right
,
is
n't
it
?
Transport
cost
penalty
?
"
she
added
with
a
pained
expression
.
"
Yes
,
Prime
Minister
.
"
"
But
why
?
Surely
the
expression
suggests
that
we
are
being
penalised
into
paying
more
than
our
EEC
partners
.
How
can
this
be
?
We
ship
exports
to
Europe
and
it
costs
X
pounds
.
Our
partners
in
the
EEC
ship
their
exports
to
us
,
and
again
it
costs
the
same
X
pounds
.
So
where
does
the
penalty
come
in
?
"
It
comes
in
,
"
said
Mark
,
"
when
you
consider
exports
as
a
proportion
of
total
output
.
A
European
plant
will
probably
sell
around
four
fifths
of
its
total
output
on
the
European
mainland
,
principally
within
the
so-called
Golden
Triangle
countries
of
West
Germany
,
France
,
Belgium
and
Holland
at
the
centre
of
the
market
.
The
remaining
one
fifth
of
output
will
be
exported
to
the
long-distance
peripheral
markets
of
the
United
Kingdom
and
Italy
,
etcetera
,
so
when
you
export
from
a
UK
manufacturing
base
you
ship
four
fifths
of
the
output
over
relatively
longer
distances
,
hence
the
UK
transport
cost
penalty
.
"
The
Prime
Minister
was
nodding
agreement
long
before
Mark
had
finished
.
"
Yes
,
I
see
.
But
does
n't
that
mean
that
most
of
the
European
investment
will
always
tend
to
go
to
the
centrally
placed
Golden
Triangle
countries
who
occupy
this
privileged
position
rather
than
to
the
United
Kingdom
and
other
peripheral
countries
who
are
in
less
favoured
areas
?
"
Yes
,
it
does
mean
just
that
,
"
Mark
said
.
"
But
such
a
situation
simply
strengthens
the
strong
,
and
weakens
the
weak
,
does
n't
it
?
"
the
Prime
Minister
said
,
eyebrows
raised
.
"
How
does
a
large
industrial
country
,
such
as
the
UK
rebuild
and
expand
its
industrial
base
,
and
correct
a
worsening
balance
of
trade
in
manufactured
products
,
if
investment
location
decisions
by
the
multi-nationals
go
against
it
on
such
grounds
?
,
"
I
am
afraid
,
Prime
Minister
,
the
answer
is
that
we
have
to
be
more
efficient
than
our
European
competitors
.
"
Mark
answered
in
a
matter
of
fact
voice
.
Transport
costs
do
impose
a
penalty
.
We
've
got
to
live
with
it
.
And
beat
it
.
We
've
got
to
absorb
these
costs
by
being
super-efficient
.
"
Again
the
Prime
Minister
was
nodding
her
agreement
.
"
But
,
"
Mark
continued
,
transport
costs
are
only
one
of
the
factors
which
have
placed
British
industry
at
a
disadvantage
in
recent
years
.
"
"
And
what
are
the
others
,
Mr
Sanders
?
"
"
If
you
'll
forgive
me
saying
so
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
Mark
replied
cautiously
,
"
successive
British
Governments
and
the
trade
unions
have
n't
exactly
helped
.
"
The
steely
smile
was
glimpsed
briefly
.
"
I
think
that
's
something
you
are
really
going
to
have
to
explain
,
Mr
Sanders
,
"
she
said
quizzically
in
a
pained
expression
.
"
If
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
he
continued
,
"
Britain
has
consistently
lost
out
because
-
.
"
He
had
been
speaking
for
some
five
minutes
or
more
with
force
and
conviction
,
carried
away
by
the
things
which
concerned
him
greatly
.
Now
,
suddenly
,
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
go
a
little
"
over
the
top
"
.
At
these
meetings
viewpoints
were
expressed
in
a
suitably
detached
manner
.
"
I
'm
afraid
I
've
gone
on
a
bit
,
My
Lord
Chairman
,
"
he
said
apologetically
.
"
I
think
I
've
said
enough
.
Probably
too
much
.
"
"
Not
at
all
,
"
put
in
the
Prime
Minister
,
reassuringly
.
"
It
's
only
when
you
let
your
hair
down
that
others
can
see
the
real
person
hiding
under
the
hat
.
I
personally
have
found
your
candour
very
refreshing
.
It
's
such
a
change
to
hear
someone
say
what
he
really
believes
-
.
"
and
a
warm
smile
blazed
.
"
Almost
never
happens
in
politics
.
"
The
laughter
was
general
.
"
Now
Mr
Sanders
,
"
she
continued
,
"
can
we
ask
you
to
wear
your
European
hat
?
Spain
and
Austria
are
peripheral
countries
are
n't
they
?
So
why
is
it
that
your
company
,
and
certain
other
major
multi-nationals
,
plan
to
invest
heavily
in
those
countries
?
,
She
cocked
her
head
to
one
side
after
she
had
posed
the
question
.
"
Spain
erects
huge
barriers
which
make
it
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
for
vehicle
and
component
imports
to
enter
that
country
,
"
Mark
said
.
"
So
if
my
company
wishes
to
supply
the
domestic
market
of
this
large
and
expanding
population
,
it
has
no
alternative
but
to
manufacture
from
within
the
country
itself
.
Spanish
rules
and
regulations
then
determine
what
percentage
of
total
output
will
be
exported
and
what
the
local
component
content
will
be
.
"
Similarly
,
the
Austrian
Government
has
made
it
clear
that
unless
multi-nationals
manufacture
vehicles
or
components
within
the
country
to
correct
its
trade
deficit
,
then
it
will
be
obliged
to
take
appropriate
steps
to
close
its
domestic
markets
to
their
products
.
"
The
Prime
Minister
clasped
her
hands
together
.
"
How
very
interesting
.
And
pray
do
tell
me
which
countries
will
have
to
accept
the
exports
of
motor
vehicles
or
components
from
Spain
,
say
,
as
a
result
of
anything
which
might
be
agreed
between
United
Motors
and
the
Spanish
Government
?
"
As
Mark
began
to
reply
,
she
said
the
first
name
with
him
,
nodding
her
head
the
while
.
"
Great
Britain
-
of
course
,
of
course
.
And
is
that
free
and
fair
European
trade
,
Mr
Sanders
?
"
She
asked
with
more
than
a
hint
of
sarcasm
in
her
voice
.
"
My
company
does
n't
make
Government
rules
and
regulations
,
Prime
Minister
,
"
he
replied
.
"
We
comply
with
them
or
we
are
excluded
from
these
markets
.
"
"
Quite
so
.
But
would
you
accept
that
such
discriminatory
rules
and
regulations
operate
to
this
country
's
clear
disadvantage
?
"
"
Of
course
,
"
Mark
agreed
.
"
Without
question
.
"
The
first
lady
nodded
and
went
on
nodding
for
several
seconds
in
quiet
contemplation
before
putting
two
further
questions
to
him
concerning
European
regional
incentives
,
Government
grants
and
subsidies
and
their
cost
distorting
influence
on
investment
location
decisions
.
Mark
answered
in
the
traditional
matter-of-fact
manner
,
parading
all
the
relevant
factors
and
letting
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
.
The
Prime
Minister
departed
a
short
time
later
with
the
Ministers
of
Transport
and
Energy
escorted
by
Lord
Hampshire
.
In
all
,
she
had
spent
ninety
minutes
at
the
meeting
.
During
the
lunch
break
,
the
Chairman
took
Mark
to
one
side
.
"
Before
she
left
,
the
PM
told
me
how
pleased
she
was
that
you
were
so
frank
.
And
she
's
delighted
that
you
have
accepted
the
invitation
to
address
the
European
Commission
on
the
subject
in
Dublin
.
She
's
looking
for
ways
and
means
of
redressing
Britain
's
excessive
contribution
to
the
European
budget
which
,
as
you
know
,
is
the
highest
in
the
community
.
She
believes
that
with
your
practical
experience
at
the
sharp
end
in
Europe
you
will
be
able
to
provide
much
needed
ammunition
to
support
her
appeal
which
is
to
be
submitted
to
the
Commission
and
the
Council
of
Ministers
.
The
next
day
,
Mark
told
Millie
,
his
secretary
,
that
the
Corporation
's
plans
for
reorganisation
would
involve
the
elimination
of
regional
management
.
She
had
been
expecting
the
news
,
because
of
her
privileged
position
in
the
"
Petticoat
Mafia
"
but
it
none-the-less
visibly
upset
her
.
She
had
what
was
generally
regarded
by
other
top
secretaries
as
the
most
interesting
job
in
European
component
operations
,
and
took
a
great
personal
interest
in
her
work
.
As
a
long-service
employee
she
knew
from
first-hand
experience
the
contribution
Mark
had
made
to
the
expansion
of
the
Corporation
over
the
years
.
"
It
is
n't
fair
!
"
she
exclaimed
angrily
.
"
Fair
or
not
,
"
Mark
said
,
trying
to
speak
lightly
,
"
it
's
what
's
going
to
happen
.
The
parting
of
the
ways
,
I
'm
afraid
,
after
all
these
years
.
But
do
n't
worry
.
It
has
already
been
agreed
that
you
'll
be
offered
another
position
within
the
Corporation
at
the
same
salary
.
"
The
classically
attractive
forty-year-old
secretary
smiled
uncertainly
.
Her
eyes
brimmed
.
"
I
'm
not
really
concerned
about
myself
.
It
's
so
heartless
and
unfair
after
all
you
've
done
.
"
"
That
,
as
the
Americans
say
,
"
Mark
told
her
wryly
,
"
is
how
the
cookie
crumbles
.
I
suppose
I
'm
going
to
miss
the
old
firm
after
all
these
years
.
And
I
'm
going
to
miss
you
too
,
"
he
added
with
a
smile
.
"
We
've
worked
together
for
a
very
long
time
.
"
She
blinked
and
touched
the
corners
of
her
eyes
.
"
Certainly
have
.
"
"
I
've
really
enjoyed
working
with
you
,
Millie
.
Thank
you
,
"
Mark
said
with
sincerity
.
"
And
I
've
enjoyed
working
with
you
too
.
I
really
have
,
"
she
blurted
,
and
hurried
from
the
room
into
her
own
adjacent
office
.
And
there
,
privately
,
she
cried
.
It
was
a
demoralised
Don
Peters
who
drove
away
from
The
London
Hilton
and
the
all-American
farewell
party
that
had
been
laid
on
for
him
by
Clancy
McGillicuddy
.
In
response
to
the
many
toasts
from
his
American
colleagues
he
had
made
a
light-hearted
speech
at
dinner
,
which
belied
his
deep
disappointment
at
being
sent
back
to
the
States
on
a
Public
Relations
assignment
.
Sure
,
the
newly
created
position
with
its
impressive
job
title
sounded
important
,
but
that
was
only
to
impress
the
media
and
the
public
.
It
impressed
no-one
at
corporate
management
level
.
Don
Peters
had
failed
in
his
UK
assignment
and
had
effectively
blown
his
chances
of
being
moved
further
up
the
corporate
ladder
to
a
Vice
Presidency
and
,
maybe
,
to
the
Presidency
itself
.
He
turned
the
car
into
Park
Lane
and
drove
quickly
and
skilfully
through
the
maze
of
traffic
converging
on
Marble
Arch
to
emerge
in
the
correct
lane
for
the
Edgware
Road
.
By
his
side
,
the
magnificent
cosmetically-engineered
Eleanor
graphically
expressed
what
she
thought
of
the
farewell
party
through
blazing
eyes
which
darted
alarmingly
under
false
eyelashes
.
She
was
n't
demoralised
.
She
was
absolutely
livid
.
"
Do
n't
you
ever
put
me
through
that
situation
again
,
"
she
snarled
through
clenched
teeth
,
tugging
irritably
at
the
sleeve
of
her
mink
jacket
.
"
I
've
never
been
so
uncomfortable
in
all
my
life
.
It
was
utter
humiliation
.
"
"
Aw
,
come
on
now
honey
-
it
was
n't
that
bad
,
"
he
replied
dismally
,
pulling
over
to
allow
a
wailing
police
car
through
the
heavy
late
night
traffic
.
"
Huh
,
"
she
scoffed
dismissively
.
"
Who
's
kiddin'
who
?
It
was
sheer
bloody
hell
listening
to
all
those
fatuous
nincompoops
saying
what
a
great
guy
you
are
.
Bullshit
!
Sure
you
're
a
great
guy
in
their
eyes
-
you
've
done
'em
all
a
favour
by
writing
yourself
off
the
promotion
list
.
Jeez
,
they
could
n't
conceal
how
pleased
they
were
.
It
made
me
want
to
throw
up
!
"
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
with
pain
.
She
was
right
of
course
,
he
knew
that
,
but
her
words
hurt
just
the
same
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
career
he
had
failed
to
produce
the
goods
and
that
hurt
his
pride
.
He
was
also
finished
as
a
rising
executive
.
He
had
been
shunted
into
a
side-line
and
was
now
out
of
the
mainstream
traffic
for
good
.
He
knew
that
.
Trance-like
he
drove
down
the
Edgware
Road
,
responding
to
the
multitudinous
traffic
lights
with
mechanical
movements
,
while
the
agitated
Eleanor
continued
to
lash
his
unreceptive
ear
with
a
never-ending
stream
of
abuse
.
He
reflected
on
the
options
which
had
been
open
to
him
,
one
of
which
had
led
to
his
downfall
.
Eleanor
was
right
when
she
had
said
at
the
very
beginning
that
he
should
have
gone
along
with
the
corporate
planning
proposals
to
phase-out
the
UK
Vehicle
Division
as
a
manufacturing
operation
.
He
would
have
survived
if
he
had
accepted
the
plan
in
the
first
place
and
done
what
the
Corporation
had
wanted
him
to
do
instead
of
putting
forward
his
own
counter
proposals
.
But
that
was
easier
said
than
done
.
How
could
he
have
accepted
such
a
proposal
without
letting
down
the
fifty
thousand
people
who
worked
for
him
?
He
was
their
leader
.
If
he
did
n't
fight
on
their
behalf
,
who
the
hell
would
?
He
switched
on
the
headlights
as
the
car
entered
the
M1
at
Brent
Cross
.
Eleanor
's
waspish
voice
ranted
on
and
on
.
"

should
have
seen
the
smug

Don

and
unhappy
man
who
has
had
enough

she
did
.
Over
and
over
again
.
It
is
said
that
nothing
so
concentrates
a
man
's
mind
as
the
knowledge
that
he
is
to
be
hanged
in
the
morning
.
It
was
Sunday
and
Mark
was
working
on
the
address
he
was
to
give
at
Trinity
College
,
Dublin
.
To
his
pleasant
surprise
he
discovered
that
he
was
now
able
to
think
with
an
objective
clarity
which
stemmed
from
the
knowledge
that
he
was
now
free
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
speak
his
mind
without
fear
or
favour
.
He
had
touched
on
some
of
the
reasons
why
the
United
Kingdom
had
been
outsmarted
and
disadvantaged
when
he
had
spoken
before
the
Prime
Minister
at
the
meeting
of
the
Economic
Planning
Council
.
Now
he
would
debate
the
subject
in
depth
before
a
cosmopolitan
audience
of
European
and
international
politicians
,
bureaucrats
,
academic
advisers
and
international
managers
.

they
were
relaxing
in
the
garden
of
their
Buckinghamshire
home
when
Mark
broke
the
news
.
In
a
very
low-key
,
matter-of-fact
way
he
described
the
meeting
in
Muldoon
's
office
and
explained
Detroit
's
decision
to
eliminate
regional
management
.
Throughout
,
Georgina
remained
calm
and
expressionless
.

by
interjections
from

told
the
story
of
how
Mark
had
fallen
into
a
barrel
of
high
viscosity
oil
while
standing
on
the
lid
to
get
at
another
barrel
with
his
hand
pump
.
He
had
been
stripped
naked
in
the
oil
store
,
where
the
incident
had
occurred
during
their
very
first
month
as
apprentices
,
and
his
clothes
triumphantly
borne
aloft
to
the
plating
shop
to
be
washed
in
one
of
the
hot
water
tanks
.
When
the
news
hit
the
factory
floor
,
young
girls
were
sent
off
to
the
stores
with
requisitions
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
loincloth
apprentice
.
One
young
girl
who
had
stood
giggling
at
the
hapless
Mark
for
more
than
ten
minutes
was
told
that
she
could
go
back

'd

enough

When

objected

sent
back
empty
handed

she
was
shown
what
had
been
written
on

requisition

Well

I
know
what
influenced
me

It
was
a
man
named
Arthur
Billstock
.
A
toolmaker
.
I
was
put
to
work
with
him
on
the
same
bench
and
he
not
only
taught
me
toolmaking
,
he
also
taught
me
about
the
trade
union
movement
and
the
kind
of
society
he
wanted
to
see
.
"
"
Ah
,
the
local
militant
,
"
said
Andrew
.
"
No
,
not
at
all
,
"
Clem
replied
.
"
In
fact
he
was
really
a
very
quiet
and
rather
reserved
man
,
who
preferred
to
keep
in
the
background
rather
than
hog
the
limelight
.
We
talked
a
lot
during
those
months
on
the
same
bench
together
,
and
it
was
his
influence
which
set
me
on
the
trade
union
path
.
If
it
had
n't
been
for
Arthur
Billstock
,
I
would
probably
have
taken
the
same
road
as
Mark
.
That
was
the
road
we
apprentices
were
expected
to
take
.
Must
have
been
crazy
not
to
do
so
.
Might
have
ended
up

a
house
like
this

you

Mark

What
influenced
you

added

"
Well

said
Mark
,
topping
up
their
glasses
.
"
I
suppose
I
should
have
followed
Clem
into
the
trade
union
movement
.
We
apprentices
were
never
short
of
advice
on
what
was
wrong
with
society
and
the
system
.
But
I
found
it
all
too
negative
and
depressing
.
Success
was
supposed
to
be
reserved
for
those
with
silver
spoons
in
their
mouths

even
if
you
have
the
talent
and
ability
to
take
you
to
the

there
is
still
no
guarantee
that
you
will
ever

there
,

But
as
sure
as

you
certainly
wo

That
clinched
it
for
me
.
I
suppose
that
simple
precept
from
that
old
foreman
stood
me
in
good
stead
for
thirty
odd
years
,

Andrew

unaware

Mark
replied
disarmingly
.
"
Perhaps
it
will
help
me
over
the
next
thirty

"
he
added
as
an
afterthought
.
"
But
you
are
both
very
similar
men

similar

with
the

Vicky
said
,
with
the
air
of
a
very
puzzled
young
lady
.
"
Do
n't
you
still
want
the

things

"
Oh
,

we
do
,
"
her
father
told
her
.
"
We
both
want
to
improve
things
;
to
build
a
better
world
.
I
thought
that
I
could
make
my
contribution
by
joining
the
Trade
Union
movement
,
and
improve
things
from
there

"
And
I
thought
I
could

mine

making
better
products

them
to
the

said
Mark
.
"
Now
how
about
something
to
eat
?
I
'm
starving
.
"
A
few
days
later
the
national
press
carried
the
headlines
that
the
UM
plants
in
the
Midlands
had
now
been
made
idle
as
a
consequence
of
the
Merseyside
strike
.
The
flow
of
supplies
into
the
Midlands
from
the
Merseyside
works
had
dried
up
completely
and
with
no
apparent
end
to
the
stoppage
in
sight
,
lay-offs
took
immediate
effect
.
Feelings
were
running
high
at
all
plants
,
but
for
different
reasons
.
The
news
that
Don
Peters
was
being
replaced
had
been
received
with
great
disappointment
and
alarm
throughout
the
Midlands
by
management
,
unions
and
employees
alike
.
Disappointment
that
they
were
losing
the
best
American
M
D
they
had
ever
had
,
after
less
than
one
year
,
and
alarm
in
the
knowledge
that
his
demotion
almost
certainly
meant
the
end
of
the
recovery
and
expansion
plans
,
and
possibly
the
end
of
vehicle
manufacture
in
the
UK
.
Such
was
the
state
of
concern
at
the
Midlands
plants
that
conveners
and
local
members
of
Parliament
were
demanding
intervention
at
Government
level
.
Some
of
the
thirty
thousand
workers
employed
at
the
Midlands
plants
,
incensed
by
the
idleness
forced
on
them
by
the
Merseysiders
and
alarmed
at
the
bleak
prospect
ahead
,
stormed
through
the
streets
to
Clem
Bunker
's
regional
office
demanding
action
to
get
the
Merseyside
plants
back
to
work
.
Bunker
was
jostled
,
heckled
,
spat
upon
and
sworn
at
as
he
tried
to
keep
some
semblance
of
order
to
explain
the
action
he
had
already
taken
.
After
two
very
noisy
and
unruly
hours
,
with
the
local
police
trying
to
keep
law
and
order
,
the
angry
mob
reluctantly
dispersed
.
On
Merseyside
,
the
plant
had
split
into
two
factions
over
the
strike
;
those
who
supported
Clasper
in
his
demand
that
the
strike
be
continued
until
the
sacked
shop
steward
had
been
reinstated
,
and
those
who
took
the
view
that
Clasper
was
playing
power
politics
with
their
jobs
at
stake
.
The
latter
demanded
that
the
strike
be
called
off
to
avoid
even
worse
news
.
This
view
represented
the
thoughts
of
an
ever-growing
majority
whose
intuitive
feeling
was
that
the
Merseyside
plant
was
heading
for
total
and
irreversible
closure
with
the
loss
of
ten
thousand
jobs
.
Clasper
was
becoming
more
isolated
,
with
his
dwindling
support
coming
from
a
small
core
of
left-wingers
who
considered
the
fight
to
be
a
question
of
principle
,
namely
union
solidarity
against
management
.
Bunker
's
early
efforts
to
bring
about
a
settlement
had
been
angrily
brushed
aside
by
Clasper
,
who
told
the
regional
officer
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
his
help
was
not
needed
.
The
Merseyside
members
would
resolve
the
dispute
in
their
own
way
without
his
help
.
Bunker
knew
instinctively
that
Clasper
could
not
,
and
would
not
,
resolve
the
dispute
himself
and
that
the
effects
of
the
stoppage
would
very
soon
be
felt
far
beyond
the
confines
of
United
Motors
as
one
supply
industry
after
another
experienced
a
precipitous
drop
in
demand
.
He
also
knew
that
if
Clasper
was
to
be
toppled
from
his
influential
position
as
plant
convener
-
which
was
essential
to
the
long
term
recovery
of
the
plant
-
he
would
have
to
be
seen
to
be
toppled
by
his
own
members
,
acting
in
their
own
interests
.
He
therefore
resolved
to
keep
out
of
the
way
and
let
Clasper
hang
himself
.
The
Midlands
'
plants
had
been
putting
great
pressure
on
the
Merseysiders
to
call
off
the
strike
,
as
a
result
of
which
a
mass
meeting
at
Pier
Head
,
Liverpool
,
had
been
demanded
to
vote
on
the
question
of
a
return
to
work
.
Although
this
had
initially
been
rejected
out
of
hand
by
Clasper
,
he
had
been
left
in
no
doubt
that
his
members
would
hold
their
own
mass
meeting
without
him
if
he
chose
not
to
call
it
.
At
the
same
time
,
hundreds
of
workers
in
the
Midlands
plants
who
had
heard
about
the
Pier
Head
meeting
on
the
grapevine
now
decided
to
drive
up
to
Liverpool
to
influence
the
return
to
work
vote
.
Confident
that
Clasper
would
be
brought
down
by
his
own
members
without
any
interference
from
him
,
Bunker
concluded
that
his
best
course
of
action
would
be
to
emulate
Brer
Rabbit
on
this
occasion
,
and
"
lie
low
and
say
nuffin'
.
"
Mark
's
address
to
an
international
audience
at
Trinity
College
,
Dublin
,
came
as
a
shock
to
European
Commissioners
,
Government
Ministers
and
their
academic
advisers
.
He
had
been
invited
to
speak
on
the
factors
which
influenced
investment
location
decisions
as
seen
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
European
Industrial
Planning
Manager
.
He
was
the
fourth
of
twelve
speakers
over
the
three
day
conference
,
the
others
being
Ministers
,
Commissioners
,
Economists
and
Academics
,
and
had
been
introduced
by
the
Chairman
as
"
The
Man
at
the
Sharp
End
"
.
He
had
based
his
paper
strictly
on
his
own
practical
experiences
,
working
within
the
labyrinth
of
conflicting
laws
,
rules
and
regulations
imposed
by
individual
Governments
within
the
EEC
,
EFTA
and
East
Europe
.
He
sought
to
show
how
the
laws
imposed
by
certain
countries
to
attract
internationally
mobile
inward
investment
could
only
operate
to
the
detriment
of
other
states
.
He
exposed
the
many
devious
ways
in
which
Governments
bent
the
rules
of
free
trade
in
their
favour
,
while
flying
the
free
trade
banner
.
He
described
how
the
Japanese
used
a
laser
beam
strategy
within
a
poorly
drafted
law
to
penetrate
the
European
market
while
protecting
their
own
domestic
market
behind
a
dynastic
organisational
structure
which
only
permitted
import
access
when
the
dynasty
deemed
it
politically
expedient
to
do
so
.
He
itemised
the
steps
by
which
East
European
Governments
gained
access
to
the
free
markets
of
West
Europe
,
while
denying
the
same
freedom
of
access
to
West
European
manufacturers
,
and
revealed
how
reciprocal
trade
deals
negotiated
with
the
multi-nationals
resulted
in
unsuspecting
third
party
EEC
Governments
being
saddled
with
the
import
bill
.
He
then
went
on
to
describe
the
very
considerable
commercial
and
economic
disadvantages
experienced
by
peripheral
industrial
countries
compared
with
the
enormous
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
privileged
centrally
placed
Golden
Triangle
countries
and
called
to
question
the
entire
concept
of
a
European
budget
which
incredibly
penalised
the
poorer
peripheral
countries
instead
of
applying
the
penalty
the
other
way
round
.
He
concluded
his
forty-five
minute
address
by
commenting
on
the
political
factors
which
influenced
investment
location
decisions
and
emphasised
that
future
multi-national
planners
would
do
well
to
have
a
much
more
sensitive
appreciation
of
the
social
and
political
implications
of
their
actions
.
Government
intervention
would
inevitably
follow
if
Governments
had
reason
to
believe
that
their
interests
were
not
being
fairly
served
.
He
sat
down
,
knowing
in
his
heart
of
hearts
that
for
as
long
as
Randy
Mueller
had
a
major
part
to
play
in
UM
's
corporate
planning
,
his
basic
criteria
would
be
:
"
Is
it
good
for
the
Corporation
?
Is
it
good
for
the
United
States
?
And
,
above
all
,
is
it
good
for
Randy
Mueller
?
"
Delegate
after
delegate
during
the
three
day
conference
subsequently
referred
to
his
address
to
confess
that
the
real
world
of
the
International
Planning
Manager
was
a
totally
different
world
from
that
perceived
by
politicians
and
their
academic
advisers
.
One
distinguished-looking
delegate
,
who
Mark
recognised
as
the
Chairman
of
the
British
Conservative
party
,
introduced
himself
to
say
that
people
with
his
experience
should
put
themselves
forward
to
serve
in
the
European
Parliament
.
"
I
am
going
to
put
your
name
on
the
list
we
are
drawing
up
,
"
he
said
grandiloquently
.
"
I
feel
sure
that
one
of
the
industrial
constituencies
would
be
interested
in
a
chap
with
your
industrial
background
.
"
Shortly
after
his
return
to
England
,
Mark
received
an
invitation
to
address
an
all-party
Committee
of
Members
of
Parliament
.
He
was
invited
to
develop
his
Dublin
address
with
particular
reference
to
the
economic
and
commercial
disadvantages
of
peripheral
industrial
countries
,
such
as
the
United
Kingdom
,
within
the
EEC
.
He
was
also
specifically
asked
to
speak
not
as
an
executive
of
United
Motors
,
but
as
an
Englishman
.
As
he
had
been
invited
to
dine
with
Members
afterwards
,
his
secretary
had
booked
him
into
The
Howard
Hotel
,
a
few
hundred
yards
from
Parliament
Square
on
the
Victoria
Embankment
,
overlooking
the
Tower
of
London
to
the
east
and
the
Houses
of
Parliament
to
the
west
.
As
Mark
strolled
from
the
hotel
and
crossed
the
road
to
the
riverside
walk
,
he
had
a
strange
feeling
that
the
evening
ahead
would
re-shape
his
future
.
Outwardly
he
was
calm
and
composed
as
he
walked
in
the
warm
evening
sunshine
towards
the
House
,
but
like
the
swans
gliding
serenely
across
the
water
,
he
too
was
paddling
like
hell
underneath
.
Big
Ben
struck
the
quarter
hour
and
he
checked
his
watch
.
Ahead
of
him
,
the
tail-end
stragglers
of
the
daily
rush
hour
traffic
scurried
across
Westminster
Bridge
.
The
House
of
Parliament
loomed
up
and
his
heart
began
to
thump
.
He
recalled
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
impressive
building
as
a
schoolboy
on
a
day
's
outing
to
see
the
sights
of
London
.
He
could
picture
the
scene
as
if
it
were
yesterday
.
The
history
master
had
gathered
up
his
flock
and
had
paused
outside
the
source
of
power
in
the
Commonwealth
and
Empire
to
eulogize
on
the
great
men
of
the
past
who
had
entered
the
hallowed
portals
.
Mark
was
one
of
twelve
young
boys
and
girls
clustered
around
him
to
lap
up
his
words
of
wisdom
.
"
Through
these
portals
passed
such
illustrious
men
as
Pitt
,
Walpole
,
Disraeli
and
Gladstone
,
to
carve
their
names
on
the
glorious
history
of
England
,
"
he
had
said
to
his
young
and
captive
audience
.
At
the
mention
of
the
name
Disraeli
,
Mark
had
been
transported
into
a
world
of
his
own
.
His
grandfather
had
been
a
master
baker
and
,
in
one
of
the
many
family
stories
Mark
had
heard
at
his
grandfather
's
knee
,
he
had
been
told
of
how
his
great-grandfather
had
served
Benjamin
Disraeli
with
a
standing
daily
order
of
twelve
French
loaves
,
burnt
and
rasped
.
It
was
the
burning
and
rasping
bit
which
had
fascinated
Mark
.
His
grandfather
had
explained
that
the
only
true
way
to
bake
bread
was
to
burn
it
black
and
then
rasp
off
the
burnt
extremities
with
a
coarse
file
.
Mark
had
adored
his
grandparents
and
would
listen
spellbound
to
their
stories
for
hours
on
end
.
The
history
master
had
interrupted
his
reverie
with
a
smart
clip
round
the
ear
.
"
Stop
daydreaming

you

Give
us
,

the
benefit
of
your
undivided
attention

Now
sir
,
he
had
continued
acidly
,
gripping
Mark
by
the
ear
,
"
tell
me
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as

blurted
the
surprised
boy
,
and
the
other
children
giggled
hysterically
.
"
You
stupid
boy

cried
the
master

that
means

despair

One
thing
for
certain
,

,
you
wo

coming
here
to
the
Mother
of
Parliaments

give
us
all
the

your
profound
wisdom

'll
be
some
factory
workbench

you

where
,
if
you
continue
to
dream
your
stupid
little
daydreams

you
'll
end
up
chopping
your
fingers

that

"
"
Yes

Mark
had
been
twelve
at
the
time
and
beset
by
emotional
turmoil
.
His
parents
had
recently
parted
.
Now
he
recalled
how
,
on
the
second
night
after
his
mother
had
left
home
,
he
had
climbed
out
of
bed
in
the
late
evening
and
slipped
unnoticed
from
the
house
to
run
over
a
mile
to
Bournemouth
Central
Railway
Station
to
catch
a
train
to
nearby
Christchurch
,
where
his
mother
had
gone
to
live
with
her
sister
.
It
was
a
cold
night
in
late
autumn
and
the
rain
had
lashed
down
unremittingly
.
By
the
time
he
had
reached
the
shelter
of
the
station
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
.
He
had
paid
three
pence
at
the
booking
office
for
his
ticket
and
,
after
waiting
ten
minutes
or
so
on
the
cold
and
draughty
platform
for
the
next
London-bound
train
,
he
had
arrived
at
Christchurch
some
ten
minutes
later
to
run
through
torrential
rain
toward
the
group
of
cottages
which
flanked
the
open
park
in
the
town
centre
.
He
was
not
certain
which
cottage
his
aunt
rented
during
the
winter
.
In
the
spring
and
summer
she
lived
in
a
cottage
on
the
banks
of
the
river
Stour
just
below
Tuckton
bridge
.
Mark
had
spent
many
idyllic
summer
days
sailing
and
fishing
with
his
brothers
and
his
aunt
on
the
beautiful
river
,
but
had
never
been
to
her
winter
cottage
.
The
rain
continued
to
beat
down
upon
him
as
he
ran
across
the
dark
and
sodden
park
just
before
midnight
.
With
the
exception
of
one
cottage
,
where
a
light
still
shone
in
the
window
,
all
the
others
were
in
total
darkness
.
Mark
ran
to
the
one
and
only
cottage
with
the
light
and
was
as
surprised
as
his
aunt
when
she
opened
the
door
.
She
gave
a
great
gasp
of
anguished
amazement
at
the
sight
of
the
drowned
rat
of
a
boy
standing
before
her
,
the
rain
pouring
off
his
sodden
hair
to
run
in
rivulets
down
his
pale
face
.
Oh
my
God
,
Mark
sweetheart
,
"
she
cried
,
pulling
the
soaked
boy
to
her
bosom
.
"
Grace
,
"
she
called
out
to
his
mother
,
"
it
's
Mark
.
"
His
beautiful
and
adored
mother
quickly
appeared
from
the
sitting-room
and
hugged
him
nearly
to
death
on
the
doorstep
.
But
despite
his
repeated
and
heartfelt
pleas
to
his
mother
to
come
home
,
she
steadfastly
refused
to
do
so
,
and
she
never
did
.
The
divorce
was
made
absolute
two
years
later
.
Mark
stood
for
a
few
moments
at
the
corner
of
Parliament
Street
and
Bridge
Street
.
It
was
nearly
forty
years
since
the
history
master
had
bawled
him
out
on
the
pavement
over
there
,
in
front
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
"
One
thing
is
certain
Sanders
-
"
he
had
said
,
"
you
wo
n't
be
coming
here
-
.
"
Mark
crossed
Parliament
Square
and
even
the
statue
of
Churchill
appeared
to
be
growling
at
the
sorry
state
of
affairs
in
the
land
where
a
pettifogging
ex-apprentice
was
invited
to
address
Right
Honourable
Members
of
both
Houses
.
He
climbed
the
steps
leading
to
the
central
lobby
and
was
stopped
by
a
burly
policeman
who
asked
the
nature
of
his
business
.
"
Name
's
Sanders
.
I
am
addressing
an
all-party
committee
,
"
Mark
replied
,
feeling
rather
important
as
he
uttered
the
words
.
"
Bully
for
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
policeman
with
a
smile
.
"
Go
ahead
sir
.
"
Mark
passed
through
a
security
screen
to
make
his
way
to
the
impressive
central
lobby
where
the
Chairman
of
the
Committee
was
already
waiting
to
receive
him
.
It
was
six
twenty-seven
.
After
the
usual
pleasantries
he
took
Mark
along
one
of
the
labyrinth
of
corridors
flanked
with
busts
of
the
famous
,
and
stopped
before
a
heavy
oak-panelled
door
attended
by
a
liveried
usher
.
After
exchanging
a
few
words
,
the
usher
opened
the
door
and
Mark
was
escorted
into
a
debating
chamber
shaped
in
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
,
with
a
raised
dais
at
the
open
end
upon
which
were
two
heavy
oak
chairs
,
one
for
the
Chairman
and
the
other
for
the
speaker
.
The
room
had
seating
capacity
for
about
eighty
and
Mark
saw
that
it
was
about
half
full
.
Before
being
taken
to
the
platform
,
he
was
introduced
to
those
members
of
the
Committee
who
happened
to
be
milling
around
the
entrance
.
He
recognised
familiar
names
and
faces
from
all
parties
,
and
also
noticed
that
everybody
carried
copies
of
his
Dublin
paper
.
He
was
then
escorted
to
the
dais
,
where
the
Chairman
launched
into
a
brief
introduction
.
"
Your
Dublin
paper
whetted
our
appetite
,
Mr
Sanders
,
"
he
said
in
conclusion
.
"
We
now
look
forward
to
the
main
course
this
evening
.
"
Mark
rose
from
his
chair
fully
aware
that
politicians
believed
themselves
to
be
the
best
informed
people
in
the
world
,
which
made
them
a
very
sceptical
audience
for
any
speaker
.
They
sprawled
across
the
padded
benches
before
him
with
the
somewhat
jaded
air
of
men
who
expected
to
hear
nothing
new
.
He
began
jocularly
by
saying
that
he
rose
to
address
them
with
some
apprehension
,
reminded
of
a
piece
of
graffiti
he
had
seen
on
a
Whitehall
notice
board
which
had
read
,
"
I
used
to
be
indecisive
-
but
now
I
'm
not
so
sure
,
,
which
brought
a
few
chuckles
from
the
floor
.
"
I
propose
to
describe
the
very
considerable
commercial
and
economic
disadvantages
incurred
by
the
United
Kingdom
by
comparison
with
other
European
countries
when
investment
locations
"
decisions
are
taken
by
multi-nationals
,
,
Mark
continued
.
"
And
also
to
offer
some
suggestions
as
to
how
the
UK
handicap
could
be
reduced
and
its
disadvantages
turned
to
its
advantage
.
"
A
few
eyebrows
were
raised
at
such
unequivocal
presumptions
.
"
You
have
also
invited
me
to
wear
a
British
hat
,
"
Mark
continued
.
"
It
will
be
a
pleasant
change
to
do
so
.
"
He
began
by
giving
several
examples
of
how
Governments
in
both
West
and
East
Europe
had
obtained
major
United
Motors
'
investment
projects
by
highly
discriminatory
and
blatantly
unfair
means
,
which
had
operated
to
the
detriment
of
the
UK
.
He
was
suddenly
thrown
off
balance
by
the
hurried
departure
of
a
Minister
.
He
was
aware
that
Members
had
to
come
and
go
at
irregular
intervals
at
the
behest
of
their
lords
and
masters
when
the
House
was
in
session
,
but
he
feared
the
worst
.
He
faltered
,
cleared
his
throat
,
drank
liberally
from
the
glass
before
him
,
and
continued
.
His
morale
was
uplifted
a
few
minutes
later
when
the
same
Minister
returned
with
a
gaggle
of
additional
members
evidently
called
from
the
floor
of
the
House
.
Mark
warmed
to
the
task
and
continued
with
renewed
confidence
.
"
There
are
many
instances
where
UK
investment
and
product
costs
have
been
up
to
twenty
per
cent
below
other
European
countries
,
but
the
investment
has
still
been
located
on
the
continent
because
of
unfair
political
pressures
and
highly
discriminatory
practices
,
"
he
added
to
gasps
of
pained
surprise
.
"
The
Treaty
of
Rome
rules
on
competitive
costs
and
prices
have
been
blatantly
disregarded
by
certain
countries
and
the
multi-nationals
,
"
he
added
.
"
Just
consider
,
for
example
,
the
adverse
economic
effect
on
Britain
of
Ford
's
highly
discriminatory
investment
plan
agreed
with
the
Spanish
Government
-
.
"
For
the
best
part
of
an
hour
he
exposed
what
was
really
going
on
in
the
international
motor
industry
.
His
audience
was
very
quiet
.
Hardly
a
muscle
moved
.
"
Corporate
plans
of
the
Fords
,
UMs
and
Chryslers

world

shape
our
destiny
.
They
determine
whether
Britain
is
to
be
a
winner
or
loser
country
.
Sadly
for
Britain
they
have
already
made
the
decision
that
Britain
is
to
be
a
loser
country

"
he
said
dramatically
.
Pained
expressions
crossed
the
faces
of
the
now
alarmed
politicians
.
"
For
example
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
The
corporate
plan
of
United
Motors
is
to
phase-out
vehicle
and
component
manufacture

import

Europe

Far
East

hundred

thousand

supplier
chain

"
he
added
.
There
was
a
gasp
at
this
disclosure
.
Constituency
problems
now
loomed
large
.
"
By
the
late
eighties
the
global
plans
of
the
major
US
multinationals
will
have
created
a
massive
UK
trade
deficit
of
around
seven
billion
pounds
which
will
go
on
increasing
with
the
growth
of
the
number
of
vehicles
in
use
.
These
companies
have
been
Britain
's
top
exporters
in
the
past
.
Seven
years
from
now
they
will
be
Britain

the
effect
on
the
pound
sterling
and
on
Britain
's
economic
standing
in
the
world

trade
gap
widens

he
asked
ominously
.
"

frightening
scenario
I
outline
to
you

Mark
's
voice
had
trailed
away
to
a
whisper
.
His
words
had
produced
group
paralysis
.
Not
a
muscle
moved
.
Mark
was
now
speaking
out
with
a
vengeance
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
free
from
corporate
restraints
,
to
say
what
he
really
thought
.
He
had
no
qualms
in
doing
so
.
If
those
with
inside
knowledge
of
the
facts
did
n't
speak
up
for
Britain

who
the
hell
would
?
That
was
his
justification
.
His
eyes
ranged
the
room
.
"
The
Prime
Minister
has
clearly
stated
her
intention

bring

industrial
regeneration

asked

say
if
the
roles
were
reversed
?
"
he
added
to
nods
from
all
quarters
.
Mark
paused
again
to
take
a
very
long
drink
.
"
Fortunately
Britain
can
win
if
we
learn
from
past
mistakes
,
and
I
would
now
like
to
conclude
by
outlining
certain
strategic
proposals
for
your
consideration
,
which
would
put
Britain
firmly
on
the
upward
path
to
meet
the
Prime
Minister
's
long-term
objectives
.
"
Mark
then
described
a
ten
point
plan
and
summarised
its
resultant
effect
.
The
UK
vehicle
and
component
industry
sectors
alone
would
progressively
benefit
to
the
value
of
eight
billion
pounds
sterling
by
year
five
.
This
would
correct
the
Motor
industry
trade
imbalance
without
the
need
to
export
one
additional
unit
.
Unemployment
in
the
sector
would
be
reduced
by
two
hundred
thousand
,
and
existing
manufacturing
capacity
,
previously
made
idle
by
imports
,
would
once
more
be
fully
utilised
,
thus
improving
operating
profit
and
return
on
investment
.
Mark
ended
his
address
by
saying
,
"
The
European
and
international
trade
war
is
really
between
those
Governments
who
fix
the
rules
of
the
game
to
suit
themselves
,
and
those
who
play
the
game
according
to
Treaty
of
Rome
rules
.
Britain
has
been
a
loser
country
in
a
manifestly
unfair
trade
environment
.
It
has
allowed
itself
to
be
outsmarted
by
governments
who
are
not
afraid
to
bend
the
rules
in
their
favour
,
aided
and
abetted
by
American
multi-nationals
whose
allegiance
is
to
the
United
States
,
naturally
.
Britain
is
expendable
.
"
He
looked
around
him
.
"
Why
not
think
and
act
as
Great
Britain
Incorporate
?
"
.
he
asked
.
Unbeknown
to
Mark
,
one
of
the
titled
politicians
present
also
happened
to
be
an
international
banker
and
financial
advisor
to
several
US
corporations
.
He
phoned
New
York
immediately
after
the
Westminster
meeting
.
A
voice
at
the
other
end
said
wearily
in
a
faintly
Irish
accent
.
"
Ah
well
.
I
suppose
we
will
have
to
take
appropriate
action
will
we
not
-
.
Thanks
for
putting
me
in
the
picture
,
Patrick
.
"
The
magnate
placed
the
phone
back
on
the
receiver
-
slowly
.
"
Thorns
left
to
fester
-
"
he
mused
.
"
Maybe
we
should
contact
the
special
outside
Agency
.
"
He
thought
very
,
very
carefully
for
a
minute
or
more
and
then
picked
up
his
private
phone
and
dialled
a
number
.
Two
days
later
,
Mark
received
a
phone
call
from
10
,
Downing
Street
,
asking
for
permission
to
publish
the
Dublin
paper
,
and
his
submission
to
the
House
Select
Committee
,
as
an
appendix
to
the
Government
's
proposed
White
Paper
shortly
to
go
before
the
House
.
He
readily
gave
his
approval
.
At
Question
Time
in
the
House
,
the
Prime
Minister
agreed
that
a
paper
submitted
by
a
European
Planning
Manager
,
now
being
studied
by
the
Government
and
the
European
Commission
appeared
to
offer
real
solutions
to
Britain
's
excessive
contribution
to
the
European
budget
.
Mark
received
several
letters
and
phone
calls
from
Members
of
Parliament
,
all
but
one
in
support
of
his
two
papers
and
proposals
.
The
Member
who
wrote
to
express
his
disagreement
invited
Mark
to
the
House
to
discuss
his
reasons
for
taking
the
opposite
viewpoint
.
He
received
Mark
in
the
central
lobby
and
took
him
to
the
Members
'
tea
room
for
a
chat
over
a
pot
of
tea
.
He
was
a
young
lawyer
of
about
thirty
in
his
first
year
in
Parliament
,
who
had
sufficiently
impressed
someone
in
Government
to
have
been
given
the
job
of
Junior
Minister
at
the
Trade
office
.
He
came
straight
to
the
point
in
a
rather
superior
manner
,
saying
that
he
was
a
European
federalist
and
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
it
did
n't
matter
a
tuppeny
damn
whether
industrial
investments
took
place
in
Germany
,
France
or
the
UK
.
He
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
irrelevant
whether
Britain
had
an
industrial
base
at
all
if
it
could
be
shown
that
it
would
be
more
sensible
,
from
a
European
point
of
view
,
for
Britain
to
become
a
service
nation
importing
its
manufactured
product
requirements
.
Mark
listened
aghast
at
the
naive
and
dangerous
idealism
of
the
young
,
starry-eyed
politician
,
who
was
light
years
away
from
knowing
what
really
went
on
at
the
sharp
end
of
European
and
international
trade
.
"
If
you
believe
that
,
sir
,
"
said
Mark
with
as
much
politeness
as
he
could
muster
,
"
you
will
naturally
not
share
the
concern
I
have
expressed
in
my
papers
.
We
are
obviously
poles
apart
.
Do
you
wish
to
discuss
the
subject
further
,
or
would
we
both
be
wasting
our
time
?
"
"
Wasting
our
time
,
I
think
.
"
said
the
young
Minister
,
forcing
a
laugh
.
"
But
as
I
have
invited
you
here
,
let's
discuss
the
subject
a
little
further
at
least
.
"
Mark
asked
him
how
he
could
reconcile
his
views
with
what
was
clearly
Britain
s
basic
needs
;
the
need
to
maintain
a
strong
manufacturing
base
as
a
defence
capability
;
the
need
to
correct
a
massive
and
worsening
trade
deficit
on
manufactured
products
;
and
the
need
to
provide
talented
school-leavers
with
creative
career
opportunities
in
the
manufacturing
sector
as
designers
,
physicists
,
chemists
and
engineers
as
opposed
to
the
more
mundane
jobs
in
the
service
sector
as
warehousemen
and
handlers
of
other
countries
'
goods
.
The
young
politician
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
"
Irrelevancies
,
"
he
said
dismissively
.
"
Top
talent
will
always
be
in
demand
where
the
jobs
are
,
and
if
the
jobs
are
on
the
continent
,
so
be
it
.
National
trade
deficits
will
become
meaningless
under
a
European
monetary
system
with
a
common
currency
.
And
as
for
defence
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
Britain
would
be
defended
by
arms
manufactured
in
Germany
or
France
just
as
well
as
by
arms
manufactured
in
Britain
,
if
this
were
necessary
for
good
economic
reasons
.
"
Mark
raised
an
eyebrow
.
"
Your
belief
that
Germany
or
France
would
unfailingly
defend
Britain
and
British
interests
against
an
aggressor
is
not
one
that
I
share
.
Does
the
Minister
of
Defence
share
your
views
?
,
"
No
,
he
does
not
!
"
snapped
the
Junior
Minister
of
Trade
.
"
Thank
God
for
that
,
"
Mark
declaimed
.
"
Your
views
are
too
simplistic
for
me
,
"
said
the
young
politician
loftily
.
"
As
you
say
,
we
are
poles
apart
.
Let's
leave
it
at
that
.
"
He
rose
to
leave
and
Mark
followed
.
"
Before
you
entered
Parliament
,
what
did
you
do
?
"
Mark
asked
.
The
young
man
's
head
went
up
.
"
I
was
-
I
am
-
a
barrister
.
"
"
But
you
are
a
Junior
Minister
of
Trade
.
You
're
not
attached
to
the
Attorney
General
's
office
,
"
said
Mark
with
an
air
of
feigned
surprise
.
The
Junior
Minister
pulled
himself
up
to
his
full
height
of
five
foot
three
,
and
in
a
plummy
voice
rich
with
haughty
disdain
said
,
"
What
difference
does
that
make
?
"
"
Well
,
you
would
n't
expect
an
industrial
manager
to
be
made
Attorney
General
,
would
you
?
"
Mark
asked
.
The
young
politician
tugged
at
an
ear
lobe
and
eyed
him
narrowly
.
"
By
that
remark
,
I
take
it
you
mean
that
I
know
little
or
nothing
about
industrial
or
trade
matters
?
"
Mark
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
.
"
I
think
it
would
be
a
great
presumption
on
your
part
if
you
thought
you
did
,
"
he
replied
firmly
,
putting
the
young
man
down
.
The
self-important
politician
smiled
coldly
.
"
You
have
a
nice
way
of
expressing
yourself
which
,
I
suppose
,
reflects
your
industrial
background
.
"
The
word
"
industrial
"
came
out
like
a
swearword
.
"
Good
day
to
you
,
sir
,
"
the
Junior
Minister
said
formally
.
"
Thank
you
for
responding
to
my
invitation
.
"
They
shook
hands
,
but
it
was
clearly
on
the
unspoken
understanding
that
they
could
still
come
out
fighting
.
They
went
their
separate
ways
:
the
young
politician
to
the
floor
of
the
House
to
promote
new
industrial
and
commercial
legislation
which
would
,
no
doubt
,
exercise
his
legal
mind
,
and
the
industrial
manager
to
the
central
lobby
,
and
the
way
out
.
Mark
drove
home
along
the
M1
reflecting
that
the
French
and
Germans
in
particular
would
be
pleased
to
erect
monuments
to
the
idealistic
young
English
politician
who
had
said
all
the
things
that
Britain
's
trade
competitors
wanted
to
hear
.
The
Germans
had
got
their
priorities
right
.
Unlike
Britain
,
they
put
national
industrial
supremacy
first
and
foremost
.
European
interests
were
secondary
to
national
objectives
,
except
where
European
political
unity
carried
more
clout
in
the
international
political
scene
.
The
British
had
been
taken
to
the
cleaners
because
foolish
politicians
in
post-war
Britain
had
elected
to
produce
sociologists
instead
of
engineers
,
and
the
predictable
end
result
was
that
Britain
had
been
short
on
wealth
creators
and
long
on
spenders
.
The
creative
and
talented
nation
that
gave
birth
to
the
Industrial
Revolution
and
produced
more
inventions
and
patents
per
head
of
population
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
,
had
turned
its
back
on
industry
and
commerce
.
Mark
felt
bitter
and
sad
.
Sad
that
his
country
had
fallen
from
the
top
of
the
European
industrial
league
,
to
joint
eighth
out
of
nine
,
and
bitter
toward
the
foolish
leaders
who
had
been
largely
responsible
for
its
decline
.
The
supercilious
young
Minister
of
Trade
was
a
typical
product
of
the
British
post-war
school
of
Parliamentarians
whose
motto
should
have
been
"
words
not
deeds
"
.
In
the
eyes
of
such
politicians
,
industrial
managers
were
not
seen
as
the
creators
of
the
nation
's
wealth
,
and
the
providers
of
job
opportunities
for
the
people
,
but
as
despoilers
of
the
environment
;
obsolete
men
,
peddling
obsolete
views
,
who
did
n't
really
fit
in
with
the
new
social
scheme
of
things
.
They
were
yesterday
's
men
.
In
their
eyes
,
Mark
Sanders
was
such
a
man
.
When
Mark
arrived
home
there
were
two
letters
,
postmarked
Detroit
,
waiting
for
him
.
One
was
a
personal
letter
from
the
President
of
United
Motors
,
Nate
Cocello
,
thanking
him
for
his
services
to
the
Corporation
.
The
other
was
from
the
Vice
President
in
charge
of
Overseas
'
Operations
,
thanking
him
for
his
personal
contribution
to
the
expansion
of
European
Component
Operations
.
Mark
read
the
letters
twice
.
He
presumed
they
had
been
written
for
him
to
use
as
references
for
his
next
employer
,
but
he
tore
them
up
angrily
.
The
next
day
Muldoon
told
him
that
he
was
returning
to
the
States
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
take
his
enforced
early
retirement
,
after
a
short
holiday
on
the
Hamble
.
Mark
's
compensation
and
pension
terms
would
be
spelt
out
to
him
by
New
York
within
the
next
two
weeks
,
after
they
had
checked
out
the
maximum
terms
permissible
under
British
law
.
"
It
has
already
been
agreed
that
the
company
will
be
as
generous
as
British
law
allows
,
"
Muldoon
said
reassuringly
.
"
The
company
wish
you
to
know
,
Mark
,
from
Nate
Cocello
down
,
that
your
work
over
the
years
is
sincerely
appreciated
.
I
know
that
the
organisational
change
has
come
as
a
shock
to
you
,
as
it
has
for
me
,
but
we
want
to
part
company
after
all
these
years
,
on
the
best
and
friendliest
of
terms
.
I
am
assured
that
you
will
be
well
looked
after
,
"
he
reiterated
.
"
In
the
meantime
you
are
free
to
do
whatever
you
wish
to
do
over
the
next
few
weeks
.
If
we
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
in
finding
another
job
,

Mark
nodded
.
"
Yes
,
sure
.
Thanks

"
he
replied
indifferently
.
The
big
,
soft
and
pliable
American
smiled
nervously
.
"
Oh
,
incidentally
Mark
,
I
understand
they
want
to
use
your
office
and
mine
for
a
couple
of
visiting
Americans
on
assignment
over
here
for
a
couple
of
months
.
Hope
you
have
n't
any
objection
.
You
can
use
the
Treasurer
's
office
until
you
leave
,
if
that
's
OK
by
you
?
He
's
on
vacation
.
"
Mark
nodded
.
"
Do
I
have
any
choice
in
the
matter
?
"
"
Sure
you
do
,
"
the
American
replied
.
But
he
did
n't
sound
certain
.
"
If
you
'd
rather
not
move
,
OK
.
I
'll
tell
'em
to
make
other
arrangements
in
the
interim
.
"
Mark
shook
his
head
.
"
No
.
I
'll
use
the
Treasurer
's
office
.
As
you
say
,
I
wo
n't
be
around
much
over
the
next
few
weeks
anyway
.
"
"
OK
,
Mark
.
I
'll
tell
'em
to
go
ahead
.
"
Mark
never
saw
Pat
Muldoon
again
.
The
American
cruised
the
Solent
for
a
few
days
while
Mark
was
tying
up
the
loose
ends
,
and
returned
to
the
States
without
paying
another
visit
to
his
office
.
He
slipped
into
the
obscurity
of
retirement
,
after
more
than
thirty
years
in
the
Corporation
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
he
had
operated
during
his
entire
working
life
:
unobtrusively
.
He
was
particularly
anxious
to
return
to
the
States
before
Mark
left
the
company
,
as
he
simply
could
n't
face
the
prospect
of
having
to
spell
out
to
the
Englishman
the
compensation
terms
and
pension
proposals
which
New
York
had
worked
out
.
Just
one
glance
had
told
Muldoon
that
they
were
very
far
from
being
as
generous
as
he
had
encouraged
Mark
to
believe
.
They
certainly
bore
no
relationship
to
the
eminently
satisfactory
compensation
and
pension
which
he
himself
would
receive
.
It
would
have
been
very
painful
for
Muldoon
to
have
to
pass
on
the
bad
news
,
so
he
decided
to
leave
for
the
States
and
let
the
Detroit
executive
personnel
Director
handle
Mark
's
affairs
.
True
to
form
,
Muldoon
simply
did
as
he
was
told
to
do
irrespective
of
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
the
decision
.
To
the
end
of
his
career
,
he
had
complete
faith
in
the
Corporation
and
in
the
infallibility
of
his
superiors
.
The
following
Sunday
Pat
Muldoon
stood
in
what
had
formerly
been
his
local
church
at
Gross
Pointe
,
Michigan
,
and
sang
to
the
heavens
,
"
If
I
can
help
somebody
,
as
I
go
along
,
then
my
living
will
not
be
in
vain
-
.
"
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
meaning
of
the
words
.
He
had
always
been
a
very
religious
man
,
which
had
helped
him
a
lot
in
the
Corporation
.
He
looked
around
the
congregation
and
saw
many
old
and
familiar
friends
and
colleagues
.
They
smiled
as
they
caught
his
eye
.
He
smiled
back
.
The
word
had
already
got
around
that
Pat
Muldoon
had
decided
to
take
retirement
in
his
old
familiar
surroundings
,
after
a
lifetime
s
dedicated
service
to
the
great
American
Corporation
.
People
liked
that
.
Pat
Muldoon
had
come
home
.
The
Director
of
Personnel
responsible
for
the
personal
affairs
of
overseas
executives
rang
Mark
from
Detroit
to
say
that
compensation
terms
had
now
been
worked
out
,
and
that
he
would
be
visiting
England
the
following
week
to
discuss
the
subject
with
him
.
"
Pat
sends
his
best
wishes
,
Mark
,
and
says
he
's
sorry
that
he
wo
n't
be
there
to
say
"
Goodbye

See

"
"
Yes

Next

said
the
Englishman
.
The
union
meeting
at
the
Pier
Head
in
Liverpool
was
in
uproar
.
Fred
Clasper
had
shouted
himself
hoarse
in
his
frenzied
efforts
to
persuade
the
vociferous
gathering
of
several
thousand
employees
from
the
strike-bound
Merseyside
vehicle
plant
to
continue
the
strike
until
management
climbed
down
and
re-instated
the
sacked
shop
steward
.
He
was
being
heckled
,
jeered
and
booed
by
the
vast
majority
,
which
included
several
hundred
workers
who
had
driven
up
from
the
Midlands
'
plants
to
influence
the
vote
.
Clasper
's
small
hard
core
of
left-wing
supporters
,
which
included
a
phalanx
of
students
from
Liverpool
University
,
had
formed
a
noisy
group
immediately
in
front
of
the
improvised
platform
,
which
consisted
of
a
large
wooden
CKD
crate
with
the
Vehicle
Divisions
'
name
stencilled
in
large
black
letters
on
each
surface
.
Clasper
stood
alone
on
the
box
,
clasping
a
hand
microphone
to
his
ranting
mouth
.
The
vituperative
messages
which
poured
forth
in
a
veritable
torrent
of
abuse
were
repeatedly
drowned
by
the
dissenting
majority
who
kept
up
an
incessant
chant
:
"
Return
to
work
.
Return

work
.
Return

.
"
Clasper
screamed
back
at
the
chanting
mob
that
they
were
management
lackeys
who
had
been
conned
by
Peters
,
and
sold
down
the
river
by
Bunker
.
He
yelled
for
union
solidarity
to
support
the
strike
and
to
bring
management
to
their
knees
,
but
to
no
avail
.
His
members
had
had
enough
.
He
knew
that
he
was
now
powerless
to
influence
the
way
they
would
vote
.
He
had
underestimated
the
new
mood
of
his
members
who
had
become
sick
and
tired
of
the
never-ending
series
of
disputes
,
which
they
knew
in
their
consciences
had
been
driving
the
Division
ever
closer
to
bankruptcy
.
Clasper
was
stranded
.
He
had
missed
the
ebb
tide
.
Faced
with
the
stark
reality
of
a
choice
between
jobs
or
no
jobs
,
the
majority
had
elected
to
work
.
It
was
n't
a
straight
management
versus
union
dispute
;
it
was
job
preservation
.
The
unions
did
n't
pay
their
weekly
wages
;
the
company
did
.
They
would
support
the
union
if
they
thought
it
to
be
in
their
interest
to
do
so
.
They
would
not
back
the
union
in
a
political
fight
with
the
company
,
or
allow
themselves
to
be
used
by
Clasper
in
a
power
struggle
between
the
convener
and
management
.
If
it
was
a
question
of
company
survival
,
or
union
survival
,
the
company
would
always
win
.
"
Piss

,

yelled
a
burly
figure
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
,
who
was
cheered
to
the
echo
for
his
advice
.

sang
another
to
the
tune
of
Auld
Lang
Syne
.
Within
seconds
,
the
sing-song
chant
had
been
taken
up
by
the
vast
majority
.

Clasper
looked
out
at
the
sea
of
open
mouths
which
chorused
against
him
.
The
chants
were
now
accompanied
by
signs
as
one
member
after
another
thrust
a
right
arm
in
the
air
to
stab
a
pointing
finger

on
the

was
shouting
at

save
for
a

at

nobody
could
hear

someone
had

thrust

aloft

he
brandished
furiously
in

the

by

Hands
grasped
the
now
frightened
convener
as
his
mates
fought
to
keep
the
pressing
mob
at
bay
.
Overwhelmed
by
the
sheer
size
and
strength
of
the
surging
crowd
,
Clasper
's
supporters
suddenly
got
the
message
and
broke
rank
,
dispersing
into
the
milling
throng
.
Police
helmets
could
be
seen
bobbing
above
the
crowd
as
a
small
corps
of
police
officers
attempted
to
force
their
way
through
to
rescue
Clasper
from
the
hands
of
the
mob
.
Before
they
could
reach
him
,
however
,
he
was
borne
aloft
like
a
javelin
and
carried
to
the
quayside
a
few
yards
away
where
he
was
dumped
unceremoniously
into
the
murky
waters
to
a
great
cheer
from
those
who
were
close
enough
to
witness
the
event
.
Then
as
if
by
magic
the
crowd
melted
away
to
let
the
struggling
policemen
through
.
Clasper
was
soon
hauled
out
of
the
water
by
the
forces
of
law
and
order
,
something
he
had
never
bargained
for
in
a
lifetime
's
fight
against
them
.
Within
two
minutes
the
mob
had
completely
dispersed
,
with
the
exception
of
the
odd
copper
or
two
and
a
few
stragglers
who
were
loth
to
leave
the
scene
of
all
the
fun
.
One
of
them
picked
up

Clasper

she
called
above
the
noise
of
the
open
tap
as
she
filled
the
kettle
for
more
tea
.
She
sniffed
again
.
Fred
Clasper
was
a
malcontent
by
nature
,
one
of
the
curious
breed
who
are
never
happy
unless
they
are
miserable
.
But
discontent
was
one
thing
.
Helpless
misery
was
another
.
Now
,
briefly
,
possibly
for
the
very
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
felt
helpless
and
miserable
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
The
death
of
his
beloved
grandfather
had
brought
him
misery
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
had
also
given
him
strength
.
It
was
as
if
,
gasping
out
his
last
breath
,
that
battered
,
bitter
and
vindictive
old
man
had
somehow
injected
him
with
some
small
portion
of
his
own
bitter
resolve
.
That
was
both
why
and
how
he
had
fought
all
his
working
life
for
what
his
grandfather
had
believed
in
-
worker
control
of
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
,
and
the
establishment
of
a
Communist
society
where
means
were
related
to
needs
.
Now
after
twelve
years
as
convener
at
the
huge
Merseyside
plant
where
he
had
effectively
established
shop-floor
control
after
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
,
he
had
been
thrown
out
by
his
own
union
members
.
He
shook
his
head
sadly
at
the
cruel
injustices
of
this
world
.
"
Bloody
management-brainwashed
gits
,
"
he
muttered
.
"

she
called
from
the
stove
.

he
mumbled
on
.
"

sniffed

plainly
upset

would

indefinitely

She
sniffed
and
went
on
sniffing
.
The
Pier
Head
incident
proved
to
be
the
turning
point
which
led
to
a
new
period
of
industrial
peace
within
the
giant
Vehicle
Division
,
unfortunately
too
late
to
avoid
the
massive
investment
switch
to
the
Continent
which
was
already
under
way
with
the
newly
approved
corporate
plan
.
Wholesale
changes
took
place
within
the
management
and
trade
union
organisations
,
with
the
good
going
out
with
the
bad
.
The
convener
who
replaced
Clasper
,
for
example
,
at
the
Merseyside
plant
,
was
elected
because
he
had
stressed
to
the
union
membership
that
the
best
way
he
could
serve
their
interest
was
to
help
make
sure
that
the
Merseyside
plant
became
the
most
efficient
plant
in
Europe
.
"
We

past
experience
where
the
other
route

he
said

loud
applause
.
"
Downhill

From
here
on
in
we
are

to
be
winners
,
not
losers

For
years
we
have
been
a
low
productivity
low-wage
plant

we
have
ended
up
losing
our

investment
opportunities

best
way

know
to
protect
the
jobs
of
our
members
.
"
Sadly
for
Britain
,
sadly
for
industrial
peace
on
Merseyside
,
the
change-of-heart
had
come
too
late
.
Plants
closed
,
men
were
sacked
,
industrial
decay
and
unemployment
spread
like
a
leprous
blight
across
the
whole
of
the
region
and
insidiously
crept
down
into
the
Midlands
.
Fred
Clasper
may
have
moved
on
to
a
new
fighting
ground
but
he
,
and
men
like
him
,
left
behind
their
destructive
trade-mark
on
Britain
for
more
than
a
decade
.
Mark
could
n't
believe
his
eyes
and
ears
when
the
American
Director
of
Overseas
'
Executive
Personnel
spelt
out
the
compensation
terms
under
the
early
retirement
deal
.
He
was
to
be
given
two
weeks
salary
for
each
year
of
service
.
This
would
give
him
eighteen
months
'
salary
as
compensation
for
loss
of
office
,
and
his
pension
was
not
to
begin
until
the
eighteen
month
period
had
elapsed
.
Mark
's
face
hardened
into
an
expression
of
bitter
hatred
.
He
had
been
deeply
hurt
twice
before
by
the
Corporation
,
but
this
last
kick
in
the
stomach
on
final
departure
was
the
last
straw
.
He
flung
the
contract
at
the
feet
of
the
American
.
"
You
call
these
terms
generous
?
"
he
demanded
angrily
.
"
I
call
it
a
bloody
insult
!
,
The
American
was
visibly
shaken
by
the
Englishman
's
angry
response
.
"

way

added
quickly

Mark
asked
sarcastically

added
sharply

great
American
salary

times
greater

nearly
ten
times
greater

would
do
any
good
.
"
Mark
jerked
the
door
open
and
turned
to
face
the
American
eyes
hardened
with
anger
.
"
Yes
,
maybe
that
's
not
a
bad
suggestion
,
"
he
said
slowly
and
deliberately
.
"
Speak
to
Jupe
by
all
means
on
my
behalf
.
Tell
him
to
stuff
it
up
his
arse
.
"
On
returning
to
his
office
the
following
Monday
,
Mark
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
now
occupied
by
visiting
American
auditors
.
"
Could
n't
you
wait
for
the
body
to
be
removed
?
"
he
said
quietly
.
The
two
Americans
leapt
to
their
feet
.
"
Sorry
,
Mr
Sanders
.
"
It
was
the
older
man
,
who
had
been
occupying
Mark
's
large
black
leather
chair
,
who
spoke
.
"
We
were
n't
expecting
you
back
.
We
were
told
you
were
using
the
Treasurer
s
office
.
Do
you
want
us
to
leave
?
,
"
No
,
"
Mark
said
with
a
sigh
.
"
No
,
do
n't
bother
.
I
knew
you
were
coming
.
Sooner
than
I
thought
.
"
"
Your
secretary
organised
the
transfer
of
files
and
your
personal
things
,
"
the
other
American
said
.
Mark
nodded
.
"
Fine
"
he
said
,
reflecting
on
the
finality
of
the
situation
.
"
Then
I
'll
leave
you
to
it
.
"
And
he
walked
out
of
his
office
for
the
very
last
time
.
The
Treasurer
's
room
was
all
dark
teak
furniture
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
portraits
of
the
top
men
in
the
Corporation
,
unlike
the
walls
of
Mark
's
office
which
were
covered
with
coloured
aerial
photographs
of
the
many
European
component
plants
which
had
come
within
his
planning
responsibility
.
Flanking
the
portrait
of
the
Chairman
,
Tom
O'Reilly
,
were
those
of
the
President
and
Chief
Executive
officer
,
Nate
Cocello
,
the
Head
of
Overseas
'
Operations
,
Mogadon
Man
,
the
General
Director
,
Europe
,
Clancy
McGillicuddy
,
and
Pat
Muldoon
as
Regional
Manager
of
European
Component
Operations
.
Mark
was
one
level
below
Muldoon
,
so
his
portrait
did
n't
make
it
among
the
VIPs
.
"
Thanks
,
Pat
,
"
he
said
sardonically
,
nodding
at
Muldoon
's
picture
.
"
Hope
I
can
do
the
same
for
you
some
day
.
"
He
sat
on
the
top
of
the
large
expanse
of
teak
desk
and
stared
coldly
at
the
men
who
had
made
it
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
biggest
corporations
in
the
world
,
employing
nearly
one
million
people
.
A
bitter
smile
crossed
his
face
as
his
eyes
ranged
over
the
top
men
in
the
giant
corporation
.
He
picked
up
the
correspondence
and
miscellaneous
papers
in
the
in-tray
and
quickly
scanned
the
contents
.
OECD
reports
,
technical
journals
,
but
no
reports
of
future
European
Planning
Committee
meetings
in
Geneva
,
or
Paris
,
Lisbon
,
Rome
or
Madrid
,
and
no
minutes
of
previous
Planning
meetings
with
resolutions
which
called
for
immediate
action
.
Nor
were
there
file
copies
of
his
reports
to
the
top
brass
on
the
European
Business
Plan
,
or
copies
of
the
vehicle
divisions
,
plan
for
the
private
and
confidential
attention
of
Mark
Sanders
.
He
was
already
struck
off
the
circulation
list
and
would
soon
be
off
the
payroll
.
He
looked
around
the
room
.
None
of
the
four
phones
would
ring
if
he
remained
at
the
desk
all
day
.
The
white
,
hot
line
certainly
would
n't
.
He
was
a
redundant
executive
and
nobody
rang
a
redundant
executive
,
except
to
say
"
Goodbye
"
.
He
opened
the
door
which
led
to
the
secretary
's
annex
.
Her
chair
was
empty
and
would
remain
empty
until
he
left
the
company
.
The
electric
typewriter
was
covered
by
its
hood
and
would
remain
covered
while
he
was
still
there
.
There
was
just
no
point
in
remaining
on
the
premises
when
you
knew
you
had
to
go
,
as
Muldoon
had
said
.
It
was
too
painful
.
"
Use
the
remaining
few
weeks
to
say
your
goodbyes
and
to
find
another
job
,
"
he
had
said
.
Mark
smiled
the
bitter
smile
of
a
disillusioned
corporate
executive
and
walked
out
of
the
office
,
closing
the
door
slowly
and
carefully
behind
him
.
Two
days
later
,
Mark
arrived
back
at
his
temporary
office
to
check
the
in-tray
and
tie
up
any
loose
ends
.
To
his
annoyance
he
found
that
the
Treasurer
's
office
was
now
completely
empty
except
for
the
four
telephones
set
down
in
a
row
on
the
bare
boards
of
the
floor
.
Even
the
carpet
had
been
removed
.
He
shook
his
head
sadly
.
Could
n't
they
have
waited
just
another
couple
of
weeks
until
he
had
officially
retired
at
the
end
of
the
month
?
Nothing
surprised
him
any
more
.
He
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
walked
slowly
down
the
corridor
until
he
reached
the
top
of
the
marble
staircase
,
passing
his
own
office
and
Pat
Muldoon
's
without
wishing
to
take
a
last
look
.
For
one
brief
moment
he
paused
to
reflect
on
the
finality
of
this
his
last
visit
which
closed
a
thirty
year
chapter
of
his
life
;
then
with
a
wry
smile
he
descended
the
impressive
stairway
.
He
was
glad
he
was
getting
out
.
Glad
,
glad
,
glad
.
For
the
first
time
in
years
he
felt
what
it
was
like
to
be
a
truly
free
man
.
Mark
crossed
the
imposing
entrance
hall
and
went
out
for
the
last
time
.
At
home
that
evening
,
Georgina
asked
Mark
if
he
had
any
future
plans
he
wished
to
discuss
with
her
.
"
What
will
you
do
,
darling
?
"
she
asked
affectionately
.
"
No
,
sweetheart
.
It
's
not
what
will
I
do
.
It
's
what
will
WE
do
?
"
he
replied
,
rising
from
his
chair
to
kiss
her
lightly
on
the
forehead
on
his
way
to
the
Scotch
decanter
.
"
Yes
,
of
course
,
darling
.
That
's
what
I
meant
to
say
.
"
What
will
WE
do
?
"
"
Well
,
I
thought
we
might
take
a
holiday
in
Canada
,
"
Mark
said
.
"
Vancouver
Island
and
the
Rockies
.
We
do
n't
have
to
rush
.
We
've
got
all
the
time
in
the
world
.
"
"
That
would
be
marvellous
.
Just
the
two
of
us
with
nothing
else
to
think
about
but
each
other
for
a
few
weeks
.
Ca
n't
think
of
anything
nicer
.
But
what
about
after
that
?
"
"
We
'll
talk
about
that
later
,
"
Mark
said
,
sipping
his
Scotch
thoughtfully
.
"
Maybe
I
'll
write
a
book
and
then
take
up
that
offer
to
have
a
go
for
the
European
Parliament
.
