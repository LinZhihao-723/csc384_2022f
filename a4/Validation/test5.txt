Once
free
of
the
knotted
tentacles
of
the
eastern
suburbs
,
Dalgliesh
made
good
time
and
by
three
he
was
driving
through
Lydsett
village
.
Here
a
right
turn
took
him
off
the
coastal
road
on
to
what
was
little
more
than
a
smoothly
macadamed
track
bordered
by
water-filled
ditches
and
fringed
by
a
golden
haze
of
reeds
,
their
lumbered
heads
straining
in
the
wind
.
And
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
thought
that
he
could
smell
the
North
Sea
,
that
potent
but
half-illusory
tang
evoking
nostalgic
memories
of
childhood
holidays
,
of
solitary
adolescent
walks
as
he
struggled
with
his
first
poems
,
of
his
aunt
's
tall
figure
at
his
side
,
binoculars
round
her
neck
,
striding
towards
the
haunts
of
her
beloved
birds
.
And
here
,
barring
the
road
,
was
the
familiar
old
farm
gate
still
in
place
.
Its
continued
presence
always
surprised
him
since
it
served
no
purpose
that
he
could
see
except
symbolically
to
cut
off
the
headland
and
to
give
travellers
pause
to
consider
whether
they
really
wanted
to
continue
.
It
swung
open
at
his
touch
but
closing
it
,
as
always
,
was
more
difficult
and
he
lugged
and
half
lifted
it
into
place
and
slipped
the
circle
of
wire
over
the
gatepost
with
a
familiar
sensation
of
having
turned
his
back
on
the
workaday
world
and
entered
country
which
,
no
matter
how
frequent
his
visits
,
would
always
be
alien
territory
.
He
was
driving
now
across
the
open
headland
towards
the
fringe
of
pine
trees
which
bordered
the
North
Sea
.
The
only
house
to
his
left
was
the
old
Victorian
rectory
,
a
square
,
red-brick
building
,
incongruous
behind
its
struggling
hedge
of
rhododendron
and
laurel
.
To
his
right
the
ground
rose
gently
towards
the
southern
cliffs
and
he
could
see
the
dark
mouth
of
a
concrete
pillbox
,
undemolished
since
the
war
,
and
as
seemingly
indestructible
as
the
great
hulks
of
wave-battered
concrete
,
remnants
of
the
old
fortifications
which
lay
half-submerged
in
the
sand
along
part
of
the
beach
.
To
the
north
the
broken
arches
and
stumps
of
the
ruined
Benedictine
abbey
gleamed
golden
in
the
afternoon
sun
against
the
crinkled
blue
of
the
sea
and
,
breasting
a
small
ridge
,
he
glimpsed
for
the
first
time
the
topsail
of
Larksoken
Mill
and
beyond
it
,
against
the
skyline
,
the
great
grey
bulk
of
Larksoken
Nuclear
power
Station
.
The
road
he
was
on
,
veering
left
,
would
lead
eventually
to
the
station
but
was
,
he
knew
,
seldom
used
since
normal
traffic
and
all
heavy
vehicles
used
the
new
access
road
to
the
north
.
The
headland
was
empty
and
almost
bare
,
the
few
straggling
trees
,
distorted
by
the
wind
,
struggled
to
keep
their
precarious
hold
in
the
uncompromising
soil
.
And
now
he
was
passing
a
second
and
more
dilapidated
pillbox
and
it
struck
him
that
the
whole
headland
had
the
desolate
look
of
an
old
battlefield
,
the
corpses
long
since
carted
away
but
the
air
vibrating
still
with
the
gunfire
of
long-lost
battles
,
while
the
power
station
loomed
over
it
like
a
grandiose
modern
monument
to
the
unknown
dead
.
On
his
previous
visits
to
Larksoken
he
had
seen
Martyr
's
Cottage
spread
out
beneath
him
when
he
and
his
aunt
had
stood
surveying
the
headland
from
the
small
top
room
under
the
cone
of
the
mill
.
But
he
had
never
been
closer
to
it
than
the
road
and
now
,
driving
up
to
it
,
it
struck
him
again
that
the
description
"
cottage
"
was
hardly
appropriate
.
It
was
a
substantial
,
two-storey
,
L-shaped
house
standing
to
the
east
of
the
track
with
walls
partly
flint
and
partly
rendered
,
enclosing
at
the
rear
a
courtyard
of
York
stone
which
gave
an
uninterrupted
view
over
fifty
yards
of
scrub
to
the
grassy
dunes
and
the
sea
.
No
one
appeared
as
he
drew
up
and
,
before
lifting
his
hand
to
the
bell
,
he
paused
to
read
the
words
of
a
stone
plaque
embedded
in
the
flints
to
the
right
of
the
door
.
In
a
cottage
on
this
site
lived
Agnes
Poley
,
Protestant
martyr
,
burned
at
Ipswich
,
15th
August
1557
,
aged
32
years
.
Ecclesiastes
chapter
3
,
verse
15
.
The
plaque
was
unadorned
,
the
letters
deeply
carved
in
an
elegant
script
reminiscent
of
Eric
Gill
,
and
Dalgliesh
remembered
his
aunt
telling
him
that
it
had
been
placed
there
by
previous
owners
in
the
late
twenties
,
when
the
cottage
was
originally
extended
.
One
of
the
advantages
of
a
religious
education
is
the
ability
to
identify
at
least
the
better-known
texts
of
scripture
and
this
was
one
which
it
needed
no
effort
of
memory
to
recall
.
As
a
delinquent
nine-year-old
at
his
prep
school
,
he
had
once
been
required
by
the
headmaster
to
write
out
in
his
best
handwriting
the
whole
of
the
third
chapter
of
Ecclesiastes
,
old
Gumboil
,
economical
in
this
as
in
all
matters
,
believing
that
writing
lines
should
combine
punishment
with
literary
and
religious
education
.
The
words
,
in
that
round
childish
script
,
had
remained
with
him
.
It
was
,
he
thought
,
an
interesting
choice
of
text
.
That
which
hath
been
is
now
;
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been
;
and
God
requireth
that
which
is
past
.
He
rang
and
there
was
only
a
short
delay
before
Alice
Mair
opened
the
door
.
He
saw
a
tall
,
handsome
woman
dressed
with
careful
and
expensive
informality
in
a
black
cashmere
sweater
with
a
silk
scarf
at
the
throat
and
fawn
trousers
.
He
would
have
recognized
her
from
her
strong
resemblance
to
her
brother
,
although
she
looked
the
elder
by
some
years
.
She
took
it
for
granted
that
each
knew
who
the
other
was
,
and
standing
aside
to
motion
him
in
she
said
:
"
It
's
good
of
you
to
be
so
accommodating
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
I
'm
afraid
Nora
Gurney
is
implacable
.
Once
she
knew
you
were
on
your
way
to
Norfolk
you
were
a
predestined
victim
.
Perhaps
you
would
bring
the
proofs
through
to
the
kitchen
.
"
It
was
a
distinguished
face
with
the
deep-set
,
widely
spaced
eyes
beneath
straight
brows
,
a
well-shaped
,
rather
secretive
mouth
and
strong
greying
hair
swept
upwards
and
curled
into
a
chignon
.
In
her
publicity
photographs
she
could
,
he
recalled
,
look
beautiful
in
a
somewhat
intimidating
,
intellectual
and
very
English
mould
.
But
seen
face
to
face
,
even
in
the
informality
of
her
own
house
,
the
absence
of
a
spark
of
sexuality
and
,
he
sensed
,
a
deep-seated
reserve
,
made
her
seem
less
feminine
and
more
formidable
than
he
had
expected
,
and
she
held
herself
stiffly
as
if
repelling
invaders
of
her
personal
space
.
The
handshake
with
which
she
had
greeted
him
had
been
cool
and
firm
and
her
brief
smile
was
surprisingly
attractive
.
He
knew
that
he
was
oversensitive
to
the
timbre
of
the
human
voice
and
hers
,
although
not
jarring
or
unpleasant
,
sounded
a
little
forced
as
if
she
were
deliberately
speaking
at
an
unnatural
pitch
.
He
followed
her
down
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
It
was
,
he
judged
,
almost
twenty
feet
long
and
obviously
served
the
triple
purpose
of
sitting
room
,
working
place
and
office
.
The
right-hand
half
of
the
room
was
a
well-equipped
kitchen
with
a
large
gas
stove
and
an
Aga
,
a
butcher
's
chopping
block
,
a
dresser
to
the
right
of
the
door
holding
an
assortment
of
gleaming
pots
,
and
a
long
working
surface
with
a
wooden
triangle
sheathing
her
assortment
of
knives
.
In
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
large
wooden
table
holding
a
stoneware
jar
of
dried
flowers
.
On
the
left-hand
wall
was
a
working
fireplace
,
the
two
recesses
fitted
with
wall-to-ceiling
bookshelves
.
To
each
side
of
the
hearth
was
a
high-backed
wicker
armchair
in
an
intricate
closely
woven
design
fitted
with
patchwork
cushions
.
There
was
an
open
roll-top
desk
facing
one
of
the
wide
windows
and
,
to
its
right
,
a
stable
door
,
the
top
half
open
,
gave
a
view
of
the
paved
courtyard
.
Dalgliesh
could
glimpse
what
was
obviously
her
herb
garden
planted
in
elegant
terracotta
pots
carefully
disposed
to
catch
the
sun
.
The
room
,
which
contained
nothing
superfluous
,
nothing
pretentious
,
was
both
pleasing
and
extraordinarily
comforting
and
,
for
a
moment
,
he
wondered
why
.
Was
it
the
faint
smell
of
herbs
and
newly
baked
dough
,
the
soft
ticking
of
the
wall-mounted
clock
which
seemed
both
to
mark
the
passing
seconds
and
yet
to
hold
time
in
thrall
,
the
rhythmic
moaning
of
the
sea
through
the
half-open
door
,
the
sense
of
well-fed
ease
conveyed
by
the
two
cushioned
armchairs
,
the
open
hearth
?
Or
was
it
that
the
kitchen
reminded
Dalgliesh
of
that
rectory
kitchen
where
the
lonely
only
child
had
found
warmth
and
undemanding
,
uncensorious
companionship
,
been
given
hot
dripping
toast
and
small
forbidden
treats
?
He
placed
the
proofs
on
the
desk
,
refused
Alice
Mair
's
offer
of
coffee
and
followed
her
back
to
the
front
door
.
She
walked
out
with
him
to
the
car
and
said
:
"
I
was
sorry
about
your
aunt
-
sorry
for
you
,
I
mean
.
I
expect
that
for
an
ornithologist
death
ceases
to
be
terrible
once
sight
and
hearing
begin
to
go
.
And
to
die
in
one
's
sleep
without
distress
to
oneself
or
inconvenience
to
others
is
an
enviable
end
.
But
you
had
known
her
for
so
long
that
she
must
have
seemed
immortal
.
"
Formal
condolences
,
he
thought
,
were
never
easy
to
speak
or
accept
and
usually
sounded
either
banal
or
insincere
.
Hers
had
been
perceptive
.
Jane
Dalgliesh
had
indeed
seemed
to
him
immortal
.
The
very
old
,
he
thought
,
make
our
past
.
Once
they
go
it
seems
for
a
moment
that
neither
it
nor
we
have
any
real
existence
.
He
said
:
"
I
do
n't
think
death
was
ever
terrible
to
her
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
really
knew
her
and
I
'm
left
wishing
I
'd
tried
harder
.
But
I
shall
miss
her
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
I
did
n't
know
her
either
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
tried
harder
too
.
She
was
a
very
private
woman
,
I
suspect
one
of
those
fortunate
people
who
find
no
other
company
more
agreeable
than
their
own
.
It
always
seems
presumptuous
to
encroach
on
that
self-sufficiency
.
Perhaps
you
share
it
.
But
if
you
can
tolerate
company
,
I
'm
having
a
few
people
,
mostly
colleagues
of
Alex
from
the
power
station
,
to
dinner
on
Thursday
night
.
Would
you
care
to
join
us
?
Seven
thirty
for
eight
.
"
It
sounded
,
he
thought
,
more
like
a
challenge
than
an
invitation
.
Somewhat
to
his
surprise
,
Dalgliesh
found
himself
accepting
.
But
then
the
whole
encounter
had
been
a
little
surprising
.
She
stood
regarding
him
with
a
serious
intensity
as
he
let
in
the
clutch
and
turned
the
car
and
he
had
the
impression
that
she
was
watching
critically
to
see
how
he
handled
it
.
But
at
least
,
he
thought
as
he
gave
a
final
wave
,
she
had
n't
asked
him
whether
he
had
come
to
Norfolk
to
help
catch
the
Whistler
.
Three
minutes
later
he
raised
his
foot
from
the
accelerator
.
Ahead
of
him
,
trudging
along
on
the
left
of
the
path
,
was
a
little
group
of
children
,
the
eldest
girl
wheeling
a
pushchair
with
two
smaller
children
,
one
each
side
of
her
,
clutching
the
bars
.
Hearing
the
noise
of
the
car
she
turned
and
he
saw
a
peaked
,
delicate
face
framed
with
red-gold
hair
.
He
recognized
the
Blaney
children
,
met
once
before
with
their
mother
walking
along
the
beach
.
Obviously
the
eldest
girl
had
been
shopping
:
the
folding
pushchair
had
a
shelf
under
the
seat
lumped
high
with
plastic
bags
.
Instinctively
he
slowed
down
.
They
were
unlikely
to
be
in
real
danger
,
the
Whistler
stalked
at
night
,
not
in
broad
daylight
,
and
no
vehicle
had
passed
him
since
he
left
the
coastal
road
.
But
the
child
looked
grossly
overburdened
and
ought
not
to
be
so
far
from
home
.
Though
he
had
never
seen
their
cottage
he
seemed
to
remember
that
his
aunt
had
told
him
that
it
lay
about
two
miles
to
the
south
.
He
recalled
what
he
knew
about
them
,
that
their
father
earned
a
precarious
living
as
a
painter
whose
innocuous
,
prettified
watercolours
were
sold
in
cafes
and
tourist
shops
along
the
coast
and
that
their
mother
had
been
desperately
ill
with
cancer
.
He
wondered
whether
Mrs
Blaney
was
still
alive
.
His
instinct
was
to
pile
the
children
into
the
car
and
drive
them
home
but
that
,
he
knew
,
was
hardly
sensible
.
Almost
certainly
the
eldest
child
-
Theresa
,
was
n't
it
?
-
had
been
taught
not
to
accept
lifts
from
strangers
,
particularly
men
,
and
he
was
virtually
a
stranger
.
On
an
impulse
he
reversed
the
Jaguar
and
drove
quickly
back
to
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
This
time
the
front
door
was
open
and
a
swathe
of
sunlight
lay
across
the
red-tiled
floor
.
Alice
Mair
had
heard
the
car
and
came
out
to
him
from
the
kitchen
,
wiping
her
hands
.
He
said
:
"
The
Blaney
children
are
walking
home
.
Theresa
is
wheeling
a
pushchair
and
trying
to
cope
with
the
twins
.
I
thought
I
could
offer
a
lift
if
I
had
a
woman
with
me
,
someone
they
know
.
"
She
said
briefly
:
"
They
know
me
.
"
Without
another
word
she
went
back
into
the
kitchen
then
came
out
to
him
,
closed
the
front
door
after
her
without
locking
it
and
got
into
the
car
.
Putting
it
into
gear
,
his
arm
brushed
her
knee
.
He
was
aware
of
an
almost
imperceptible
withdrawing
,
more
emotional
than
physical
,
a
small
delicate
gesture
of
self-containment
.
Dalgliesh
doubted
whether
that
half-imagined
recoil
had
anything
to
do
with
him
personally
,
nor
did
he
find
her
silence
disconcerting
.
Their
conversation
,
when
they
did
speak
,
was
brief
.
He
asked
:
"
Is
Mrs
Blaney
still
alive
?
"
"
No
.
She
died
six
weeks
ago
.
"
"
How
are
they
managing
?
"
"
Not
particularly
well
,
I
imagine
.
But
Ryan
Blaney
does
n't
welcome
interference
.
I
sympathize
.
Once
he
lets
down
his
defences
half
the
social
workers
in
Norfolk
,
amateur
and
professional
,
will
move
in
on
him
.
"
When
they
drew
up
beside
the
little
band
it
was
Alice
Mair
who
opened
the
car
door
and
spoke
.
"
Theresa
,
here
is
Mr
Dalgliesh
to
give
you
all
a
lift
.
He
's
Miss
Dalgliesh
's
nephew
from
Larksoken
Mill
.
One
of
the
twins
had
better
sit
on
my
lap
.
The
rest
of
you
and
the
pushchair
can
fit
into
the
back
.
"
Theresa
looked
at
Dalgliesh
without
smiling
and
said
a
grave
thank
you
.
She
reminded
him
of
pictures
of
the
young
Elizabeth
Tudor
,
the
same
red-gold
hair
framing
a
curiously
adult
face
both
secretive
and
self-composed
,
the
same
sharp
nose
and
wary
eyes
.
The
faces
of
the
twins
,
softer
editions
of
her
own
,
turned
towards
her
questioningly
then
broke
into
shy
smiles
.
They
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dressed
in
a
hurry
and
not
very
suitably
for
a
long
walk
on
the
headland
,
even
in
a
warm
autumn
.
One
wore
a
tattered
summer
dress
in
pink
spotted
cotton
with
double
flounces
,
the
other
a
pinafore
over
a
checked
blouse
.
Their
pathetically
thin
legs
were
unprotected
.
Theresa
was
wearing
jeans
and
a
grubby
sweat
shirt
with
a
map
of
London
's
Underground
across
the
front
.
Dalgliesh
found
himself
wondering
if
it
had
been
brought
back
from
a
school
trip
to
the
capital
.
It
was
too
large
for
her
and
the
wide
sleeves
of
limp
cotton
hung
from
her
freckled
arms
like
rags
thrown
over
a
stick
.
In
contrast
to
his
sisters
,
Anthony
was
over-clad
,
a
bundle
of
leggings
,
jumper
and
a
padded
jacket
topped
with
a
woollen
helmet
with
a
bobble
pulled
well
down
over
his
forehead
,
beneath
which
he
surveyed
their
busyness
,
unsmiling
,
like
a
stout
imperious
Caesar
.
Dalgliesh
got
out
of
the
Jaguar
and
tried
to
extricate
him
from
the
pushchair
,
but
the
anatomy
of
the
chair
momentarily
defeated
him
.
There
was
a
bar
beneath
which
the
child
's
rigid
legs
were
obstinately
stuck
.
The
solid
uncooperative
bundle
was
surprisingly
heavy
;
it
was
like
trying
to
manoeuvre
a
firm
and
rather
smelly
poultice
.
Theresa
gave
him
a
brief
,
pitying
smile
,
dragged
the
plastic
bags
from
beneath
the
seat
then
expertly
freed
her
brother
and
settled
him
on
her
left
hip
while
,
with
the
other
hand
,
she
collapsed
the
pushchair
,
with
a
single
vigorous
shake
.
Dalgliesh
took
the
baby
from
her
while
Theresa
helped
the
children
into
the
Jaguar
and
commanded
with
sudden
fierceness
,
"
Sit
still
.
"
Anthony
,
recognizing
incompetence
,
grasped
Dalgliesh
's
hair
firmly
with
a
sticky
hand
and
he
felt
the
momentary
touch
of
a
cheek
,
so
soft
that
it
was
like
the
fall
of
a
petal
.
Throughout
these
manoeuvrings
Alice
Mair
sat
quietly
watching
from
the
car
but
made
no
move
to
help
.
It
was
impossible
to
know
what
she
was
thinking
.
But
once
the
Jaguar
had
moved
away
she
turned
to
Theresa
and
said
in
a
voice
of
surprising
gentleness
:
"
Does
your
father
know
that
you
're
out
alone
?
"
"
Daddy
has
taken
the
van
to
Mr
Sparks
.
It
's
due
for
its
MOT
test
.
Mr
Sparks
does
n't
think
it
's
going
to
pass
.
And
I
found
we
'd
run
out
of
milk
for
Anthony
.
We
have
to
have
milk
.
And
we
wanted
some
more
disposable
nappies
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
I
'm
giving
a
dinner
party
on
Thursday
evening
.
If
your
father
agrees
,
would
you
like
to
come
and
help
with
the
table
like
you
did
last
month
?
"
"
What
are
you
going
to
cook
,
Miss
Mair
?
"
"
Put
your
head
close
so
that
I
can
whisper
.
Mr
Dalgliesh
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
guests
.
I
want
it
to
be
a
surprise
.
"
The
pale
golden
head
leaned
forward
towards
the
grey
and
Miss
Mair
whispered
.
Theresa
smiled
and
then
nodded
with
serious
satisfaction
in
a
moment
of
grave
feminine
conspiracy
.
It
was
Alice
Mair
who
directed
him
to
the
cottage
.
After
about
a
mile
they
turned
seaward
and
the
Jaguar
lurched
and
bounced
down
a
narrow
track
between
high
,
untended
hedges
of
bramble
and
elderberry
.
The
track
led
only
to
Scudder
's
Cottage
,
the
name
crudely
painted
on
a
board
nailed
to
the
gate
.
Beyond
the
cottage
it
widened
to
provide
a
rough
,
gravelled
turning
,
backed
by
a
forty-foot
bank
of
shingle
behind
which
Dalgliesh
could
hear
the
crash
and
suck
of
the
tide
.
Scudder
's
Cottage
,
small-windowed
,
picturesque
under
its
tiled
,
dipping
roof
,
was
fronted
by
a
flowering
wilderness
which
had
once
been
a
garden
.
Theresa
led
the
way
,
between
grass
almost
knee-high
bordered
by
a
riot
of
unpruned
roses
,
to
the
porch
,
then
reached
for
a
key
hung
high
on
a
nail
,
less
,
Dalgliesh
supposed
,
for
security
reasons
than
to
ensure
that
it
was
n't
lost
.
With
Dalgliesh
carrying
Anthony
they
passed
into
the
cottage
.
It
was
much
lighter
than
he
had
expected
,
largely
because
of
a
rear
door
,
now
open
,
which
led
to
a
glass
extension
giving
a
view
of
the
headland
.
He
was
aware
of
the
room
's
clutter
,
the
central
wooden
table
still
covered
with
the
remains
of
their
midday
meal
,
an
assortment
of
plates
smeared
with
tomato
sauce
,
a
half-eaten
sausage
,
a
large
bottle
of
orangeade
uncapped
;
the
children
's
clothes
thrown
over
the
back
of
a
low
nursing
chair
before
the
fireplace
,
of
the
smell
of
milk
and
bodies
and
wood
smoke
.
But
what
held
his
attention
was
a
large
oil
painting
propped
on
a
chair
and
fronting
the
door
.
It
was
a
three-quarter
portrait
in
oils
of
a
woman
,
painted
with
remarkable
power
.
It
dominated
the
room
so
that
he
and
Alice
Mair
stood
for
a
moment
,
silently
regarding
it
.
The
painter
had
avoided
caricature
,
if
only
just
,
but
the
portrait
was
,
he
felt
,
intended
less
as
a
physical
likeness
than
an
allegory
.
Behind
the
wide
,
full
mouth
,
the
arrogant
stare
of
the
eyes
,
the
dark
,
crimped
,
Pre-Raphaelite
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
,
was
a
careful
delineation
of
the
headland
,
its
objects
disposed
and
painted
with
the
meticulous
attention
to
detail
of
a
sixteenth-century
primitive
;
the
Victorian
rectory
,
the
ruined
abbey
,
the
half-demolished
pillbox
,
the
crippled
trees
,
the
small
white
mill
like
a
child
's
toy
and
,
gaunt
against
a
flaming
evening
sky
,
the
stark
outline
of
the
power
station
.
But
it
was
the
woman
,
painted
more
freely
,
who
dominated
the
landscape
,
arms
stretched
,
the
palms
facing
outwards
in
a
parody
of
blessing
.
Dalgliesh
's
private
verdict
was
that
it
was
technically
brilliant
,
but
overwrought
and
painted
,
he
felt
,
in
hatred
.
Blaney
's
intention
to
produce
a
study
of
evil
was
as
clear
as
if
the
portrait
had
been
labelled
.
It
was
so
different
from
the
artist
's
usual
work
that
without
the
bold
signature
,
the
single
surname
,
Dalgliesh
might
have
wondered
if
it
was
,
in
fact
,
his
work
.
He
recalled
Blaney
's
pallid
and
innocuous
watercolours
of
the
better-known
beauty
spots
of
Norfolk
:
Blakeney
,
St
Peter
Mancroft
and
the
cathedral
at
Norwich
,
which
he
produced
for
the
local
shops
.
They
could
have
been
painted
from
picture
postcards
and
probably
were
.
And
he
could
recall
seeing
one
or
two
small
oils
hung
in
local
restaurants
and
pubs
,
slap-dash
in
technique
and
economical
of
paint
,
but
so
different
from
the
prettified
watercolours
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
they
too
were
by
the
same
hand
.
But
this
portrait
was
different
from
either
;
the
wonder
was
that
the
artist
who
could
produce
this
disciplined
splurge
of
colour
,
this
technical
artistry
and
imagination
,
had
been
content
to
churn
out
meretricious
souvenirs
for
the
tourist
trade
.
"
You
did
n't
know
I
could
do
it
,
did
you
?
"
Absorbed
in
the
painting
,
their
ears
had
n't
caught
his
almost
silent
approach
through
the
open
door
.
He
moved
round
and
joined
them
and
stared
intently
at
the
portrait
as
if
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
.
His
daughters
,
as
though
obedient
to
some
unspoken
command
,
grouped
themselves
around
him
in
what
in
older
children
could
have
been
a
conscious
gesture
of
family
solidarity
.
Dalgliesh
had
last
seen
Blaney
six
months
earlier
splashing
alone
along
the
edge
of
the
beach
,
painting
gear
slung
over
his
shoulder
,
and
was
shocked
by
the
change
in
the
man
.
He
stood
a
gaunt
six
foot
three
in
his
torn
jeans
,
the
checked
,
woollen
shirt
open
almost
to
the
waist
,
his
long
grubby
feet
in
the
open
sandals
looking
like
dry
,
brown
bones
.
His
face
was
a
picture
of
red
ferocity
,
the
straggling
red
hair
and
beard
,
the
bloodshot
eyes
,
the
gaunt-featured
face
burnt
red
by
wind
and
sun
,
which
yet
showed
on
the
cheekbones
and
under
the
eyes
the
bruising
stain
of
tiredness
.
Dalgliesh
saw
Theresa
slip
her
hand
into
his
while
one
of
the
twins
moved
closer
to
him
and
clasped
both
arms
firmly
round
one
of
his
legs
.
Dalgliesh
thought
that
however
ferocious
he
might
appear
to
the
outside
world
his
children
had
no
fear
of
him
.
Alice
Mair
said
calmly
:
"
Good
afternoon
,
Ryan
,
"
but
did
not
appear
to
expect
an
answer
.
She
nodded
towards
the
portrait
and
went
on
:
"
It
's
remarkable
,
certainly
.
What
are
you
proposing
to
do
with
it
?
I
can
hardly
suppose
that
she
sat
for
you
or
that
it
was
commissioned
.
"
"
She
did
n't
need
to
sit
.
I
know
that
face
.
I
'm
showing
it
at
the
Norwich
Contemporary
Arts
Exhibition
on
October
the
third
if
I
can
get
it
there
.
The
van
is
out
of
use
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
I
'll
be
driving
to
London
within
the
next
week
.
I
could
collect
it
and
deliver
it
if
you
let
me
have
the
address
.
"
He
said
:
"
If
you
like
.
"
The
response
was
ungracious
but
Dalgliesh
thought
he
detected
relief
.
Then
he
added
:
"
I
'll
leave
it
packed
and
labelled
to
the
left
of
the
door
in
the
painting
shed
.
The
light
is
just
above
it
.
You
can
collect
it
whenever
it
suits
you
.
No
need
to
knock
.
"
The
last
words
had
the
force
of
a
command
,
almost
of
a
warning
.
Miss
Mair
said
:
"
I
'll
telephone
you
when
I
know
when
I
'm
going
.
By
the
way
,
I
do
n't
think
you
've
met
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
He
saw
the
children
on
the
road
and
thought
of
giving
them
a
lift
.
"
Blaney
did
n't
say
thank
you
,
but
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
held
out
his
hand
which
Dalgliesh
grasped
.
Then
he
said
gruffly
,
"
I
liked
your
aunt
.
She
telephoned
offering
to
help
when
my
wife
was
ill
and
when
I
said
there
was
nothing
she
or
anyone
could
do
,
she
did
n't
keep
fussing
.
Some
people
ca
n't
keep
away
from
a
deathbed
.
Like
the
Whistler
,
they
get
their
kicks
from
watching
people
die
.
"
"
No
,
"
said
Dalgliesh
,
"
she
never
fussed
.
I
shall
miss
her
.
I
'm
sorry
about
your
wife
.
"
Blaney
did
n't
reply
,
but
stared
hard
at
Dalgliesh
as
if
assessing
the
sincerity
of
that
simple
statement
,
and
then
said
curtly
,
"
Thank
you
for
helping
the
children
,
"
and
lifted
his
son
from
Dalgliesh
's
shoulder
.
It
was
a
clear
gesture
of
dismissal
.
Neither
of
them
spoke
as
Dalgliesh
negotiated
the
track
and
finally
turned
on
to
the
higher
road
.
It
was
as
if
the
cottage
had
exerted
some
spell
which
it
was
important
to
throw
off
before
they
talked
.
Then
he
asked
:
"
Who
is
that
woman
in
the
portrait
?
"
"
I
had
n't
realized
that
you
did
n't
know
.
Hilary
Robarts
.
She
's
Acting
Administrative
Officer
at
the
power
station
.
Actually
you
'll
meet
her
at
dinner
on
Thursday
night
.
She
bought
Scudder
's
Cottage
when
she
first
arrived
here
three
years
ago
.
She
's
been
trying
to
get
the
Blaneys
out
for
some
time
.
There
's
been
a
certain
amount
of
feeling
about
it
locally
.
"
Dalgliesh
asked
:
"
Why
does
she
want
to
gain
possession
?
Does
she
propose
to
live
there
?
"
"
I
do
n't
imagine
so
.
I
think
she
bought
it
as
an
investment
and
wants
to
sell
.
Even
a
remote
cottage
-
particularly
a
remote
cottage
-
has
value
on
this
coast
.
And
she
has
some
justice
on
her
side
.
Blaney
did
say
that
his
tenancy
would
be
short-term
.
I
think
she
feels
a
certain
resentment
that
he
used
his
wife
's
illness
,
her
death
,
and
now
uses
the
children
as
an
excuse
for
reneging
on
his
undertaking
to
leave
when
she
wanted
the
cottage
back
.
"
Dalgliesh
was
interested
that
Alice
Mair
apparently
knew
so
much
about
local
affairs
.
He
had
thought
of
her
as
essentially
a
private
woman
who
would
be
very
little
concerned
with
her
neighbours
or
their
problems
.
And
what
about
himself
?
In
his
deliberations
whether
to
sell
or
keep
on
the
mill
as
a
holiday
home
he
had
seen
it
as
a
refuge
from
London
,
eccentric
and
remote
,
providing
a
temporary
escape
from
the
demands
of
his
job
and
the
pressures
of
success
.
But
how
far
,
even
as
an
occasional
visitor
,
could
he
isolate
himself
from
the
community
,
from
their
private
tragedies
no
less
than
their
dinner
parties
?
It
would
be
simple
enough
to
avoid
their
hospitality
given
sufficient
ruthlessness
and
he
had
never
lacked
that
when
it
came
to
safeguarding
his
privacy
.
But
the
less
tangible
demands
of
neighbourliness
might
be
less
easily
shrugged
away
.
It
was
in
London
that
you
could
live
anonymously
,
could
create
your
own
ambience
,
could
deliberately
fabricate
the
persona
which
you
chose
to
present
to
the
world
.
In
the
country
you
lived
as
a
social
being
and
at
the
valuation
of
others
.
So
he
had
lived
in
childhood
and
adolescence
in
the
same
country
rectory
,
taking
part
each
Sunday
in
a
familiar
liturgy
which
reflected
,
interpreted
,
and
sanctified
the
changing
seasons
of
the
farming
year
.
It
was
a
world
he
had
relinquished
with
small
regret
and
he
had
not
expected
to
find
it
again
on
Larksoken
headland
.
But
some
of
its
obligations
were
here
,
deep-rooted
even
in
this
arid
and
unfertile
earth
.
His
aunt
had
lived
as
privately
as
any
woman
he
knew
,
but
even
she
had
visited
and
tried
to
help
the
Blaneys
.
He
thought
of
the
man
,
bereft
and
incarcerated
in
that
cluttered
cottage
behind
the
great
dyke
of
shingle
,
listening
night
after
night
to
the
never-ceasing
moaning
of
the
tide
,
and
brooding
on
the
wrongs
,
real
or
imaginary
,
which
could
inspire
that
hate-filled
portrait
.
It
could
hardly
be
healthy
for
him
or
for
his
children
.
Come
to
that
,
he
thought
grimly
,
it
could
hardly
be
healthy
for
Hilary
Robarts
.
He
asked
:
"
Does
he
get
much
official
help
with
the
children
?
It
ca
n't
be
easy
.
"
As
much
as
he
's
prepared
to
tolerate
.
The
local
authority
has
arranged
for
the
twins
to
attend
some
kind
of
daycare
centre
.
They
get
collected
most
days
.
And
Theresa
,
of
course
,
is
at
school
.
She
catches
the
bus
at
the
end
of
the
lane
.
She
and
Ryan
between
them
cope
with
the
baby
.
Meg
Dennison
-
she
housekeeps
for
the
Reverend
and
Mrs
Copley
at
the
Old
Rectory
-
thinks
we
ought
to
do
more
for
them
but
it
's
difficult
to
see
precisely
what
.
As
an
ex-schoolmistress
I
should
have
thought
she
'd
had
her
fill
of
children
and
I
make
no
pretence
at
understanding
them
.
"
Dalgliesh
remembered
her
whispered
confidence
to
Theresa
in
the
car
,
the
child
's
intent
face
and
brief
transforming
smile
,
and
thought
that
she
understood
one
child
at
least
far
better
than
she
would
probably
claim
.
But
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
portrait
.
He
said
:
"
It
must
be
uncomfortable
,
particularly
in
a
small
community
,
to
be
the
object
of
so
much
malevolence
.
"
She
understood
at
once
what
he
meant
.
"
Hatred
rather
than
malevolence
,
would
n't
you
say
?
Uncomfortable
and
rather
frightening
.
Not
that
Hilary
Robarts
is
easily
frightened
.
But
she
's
becoming
something
of
an
obsession
with
Ryan
,
particularly
since
his
wife
's
death
.
He
chooses
to
believe
that
Hilary
practically
badgered
her
into
her
grave
.
It
's
understandable
,
I
suppose
.
Human
beings
need
to
find
someone
to
blame
both
for
their
misery
and
for
their
guilt
.
Hilary
Robarts
makes
a
convenient
scapegoat
.
"
It
was
a
disagreeable
story
and
coming
as
it
did
after
the
impact
of
the
portrait
it
provoked
in
Dalgliesh
a
mixture
of
depression
and
foreboding
which
he
tried
to
shake
off
as
irrational
.
He
was
glad
to
let
the
subject
drop
and
they
drove
in
silence
until
he
left
her
at
the
gate
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
To
his
surprise
she
held
out
her
hand
and
gave
him
,
once
again
,
that
extraordinary
,
attractive
smile
.
"
I
'm
glad
you
stopped
for
the
children
.
I
'll
see
you
,
then

on
Thursday
night
.
You
will
be
able
to
make
your
own
assessment
of
Hilary
Robarts
and
compare
the
portrait
with
the
woman
.
"
As
the
Jaguar
crested
the
headland
Neil
Pascoe
was
dumping
rubbish
into
one
of
the
two
dustbins
outside
the
caravan
,
two
plastic
bags
of
empty
tins
of
soup
and
baby
food
,
soiled
disposable
napkins
,
vegetable
peelings
and
squashed
cartons
,
already
malodorous
despite
his
careful
sealing
of
the
bags
.
Firmly
replacing
the
lid
he
marvelled
,
as
he
always
did
,
at
the
difference
one
girl
and
an
eighteen-month-old
baby
could
make
to
the
volume
of
household
waste
.
Climbing
back
into
the
caravan
,
he
said
:
"

Amy
,
fitting
a
recalcitrant
new
ribbon

the
ancient
typewriter
,
did
n't
bother
to
look
up

Met
Police

It
's
probably
just
a
holiday
.
Or
perhaps
he
's
here
to
decide
what
to
do
with
the
mill
.
He
can
hardly
live
here
and
work
in
London
.
"
"
So
why
do
n't
you
ask
him
if
we
can
have
it
?
Rent-free
,
of
course
.
We
could
caretake

You
're
always
saying
it
's
antisocial

people

have
second
homes

property
empty

Go
on

have
a
word
with
him
.
I
dare
you
.
Or
I
will
if
you
're
too
scared
.
"
It
was
,
he
knew
,
less
a
suggestion
than
a
half-serious
threat
.
But
for
a
moment
,
gladdened
by
her
easy
assumption
that
they
were
a
couple
,
that
she
was
n't
thinking
of
leaving
him
,
he
actually
entertained
the
idea
as
a
feasible
solution
to
all
their
problems
.
Well
,
almost
all
.
But
a
glance
round
the
caravan
restored
him
to
reality
.
It
was
becoming
difficult
to
remember
how
it
had
looked
fifteen
months
ago
,
before
Amy
and
Timmy
had
entered
his
life
;
the
homemade
shelves
of
orange
boxes
ranged
against
the
wall
which
had
held
his
books
,
the
two
mugs
,
two
plates
and
one
soup
bowl
,
which
had
been
adequate
for
his
needs
,
neatly
stacked
in
the
cupboard
,
the
excessive
cleanliness
of
the
small
kitchen
and
lavatory
,
his
bed
smooth
under
the
coverlet
of
knitted
woollen
squares
,
the
single
hanging
cupboard
which
had
been
sufficient
for
his
meagre
wardrobe
,
his
other
possessions
boxed
and
tidily
stowed
in
the
chest
under
the
seat
.
It
was
n't
that
Amy
was
dirty
;
she
was
continually
washing
herself
,
her
hair
,
her
few
clothes

the
tap
outside
Cliff
Cottage
to
which
they
had
access
.
He
was
continually
having
to
fetch
new
Calor-gas
cylinders
from
the
general
store
in
Lydsett
village
and
steam
from
the
almost
constantly
boiling
kettle
made
the
caravan
a
damp
mist
.
But
she
was
chronically
untidy
;
her
clothes
lying
where
she
had
dropped
them
,
shoes
kicked
under
the
table
,
knickers
and
bras
stuffed
beneath
cushions
and
Timmy
's
toys
littering
the
floor
and
table
top
.
The
make-up
,
which
seemed
to
be
her
sole
extravagance
,
cluttered
the
single
shelf
in
the
cramped
shower
and
he
would
find
half-empty
,
opened
jars
and
bottles
in
the
food
cupboard
.
He
smiled
as
he
pictured
Commander
Adam
Dalgliesh
,
that
no
doubt
fastidious
widower
,
making
his
way
through
the
accumulated
mess
to
discuss
their
suitability
as
caretakers
at
Larksoken
Mill
.
And
then
there
were
the
animals
.
She
was
incurably
sentimental
about
wildlife
and
they
were
seldom
without
some
maimed
,
deserted
or
starving
creatures
.
Seagulls
,
their
wings
covered
with
oil
,
were
cleansed
,
caged
and
then
let
free
.
There
had
been
a
stray
mongrel
whom
they
had
named
Herbert
,
with
a
large
uncoordinated
body
and
look
of
lugubrious
disapproval
who
had
attached
himself
to
them
for
a
few
weeks
and
whose
voracious
appetite
for
dog-meat
and
biscuits
had
had
a
ruinous
effect
on
the
housekeeping
.
Happily
Herbert
had
eventually
trotted
off
and
to
Amy
's
distress
had
been
seen
no
more
,
although
his
lead
still
hung
on
the
caravan
door
,
a
limp
reminder
of
her
bereavement
.
And
now
there
were
the
two
black
and
white
kittens
found
abandoned
on
the
grass
verge
of
the
coast
road
as
they
came
back
in
the
van
from
Ipswich
.
Amy
had
screamed
for
him
to
stop
and
,
scooping
up
the
kittens
,
had
thrown
back
her
head
and
howled
obscenities
at
the
cruelty
of
human
beings
.
They
slept
on
Amy
's
bed
,
drank
indiscriminately
from
any
saucer
of
milk
or
tea
put
down
for
them
,
were
remarkably
docile
under
Timmy
's
boisterous
caresses
and
,
happily
,
seemed
content
with
the
cheapest
kind
of
tinned
cat
food
.
But
he
was
glad
to
have
them
because
they
too
seemed
to
offer
some
assurance
that
Amy
would
stay
.
He
had
found
her
-
and
he
used
the
word
much
as
he
might
of
finding
a
particularly
beautiful
sea-washed
stone
-
one
late
June
afternoon
the
previous
year
.
She
had
been
sitting
on
the
shingle
staring
out
to
sea
,
her
arms
clasped
round
her
knees
,
Timmy
lying
asleep
on
the
small
rug
beside
her
.
He
was
wearing
a
blue
fleecy
sleeping
suit
embroidered
with
ducks
from
which
his
round
face
seemed
to
have
spilled
over
,
still
and
pink
as
a
porcelain
,
Painted
doll
,
the
delicate
lashes
brush-tipped
on
the
plump
cheeks
.
And
she
,
too
,
had
something
of
the
precision
and
contrived
charm
of
a
doll
with
an
almost
round
head
poised
"
on
a
long
delicate
neck
,
a
snub
nose
with
a
splatter
of
freckles
,
a
small
mouth
with
a
full
upper
lip
beautifully
curved
and
a
bristle
of
cropped
hair
,
originally
fair
but
with
bright
orange
tips
which
caught
the
sun
and
trembled
in
the
breeze
so
that
the
whole
head
seemed
for
a
moment
to
have
a
vivid
life
separated
from
the
rest
of
her
body
and
,
the
image
changing
,
he
had
seen
her
as
a
bright
exotic
flower
.
He
could
remember
every
detail
of
that
first
meeting
.
She
had
been
wearing
blue
faded
jeans
,
and
a
white
sweat
shirt
flattened
against
the
pointed
nipples
and
the
upturned
breasts
;
the
cotton
seeming
too
thin
a
protection
against
the
freshening
onshore
breeze
.
As
he
approached
tentatively
,
wanting
to
seem
friendly
but
not
to
alarm
her
,
she
had
turned
on
him
a
long
and
curious
glance
from
remarkable
,
slanted
,
violet-blue
eyes
.
Standing
over
her
,
he
had
said
:
"
My
name
's
Neil
Pascoe
.
I
live
in
that
caravan
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
.
I
'm
just
going
to
make
some
tea
.
I
wondered
if
you
"
d
like
a
mug
.
"
"
I
do
n't
mind
,
if
you
're
making
it
.
"
She
had
turned
away
at
once
and
gazed
again
out
to
sea
.
Five
minutes
later
he
had
slithered
down
the
sandy
cliffs
,
a
mug
of
tea
slopping
in
each
hand
.
He
heard
himself
say
:
"
May
I
sit
down
?
"
"
Please
yourself
.
The
beach
is
free
.
"
So
he
had
lowered
himself
to
sit
beside
her
and
together
they
had
stared
wordlessly
towards
the
horizon
.
Looking
back
on
it
he
was
amazed
both
at
his
boldness
and
at
the
seeming
inevitability
and
naturalness
of
that
first
encounter
.
It
was
several
minutes
before
he
had
found
the
courage
to
ask
her
how
she
had
got
to
the
beach
.
She
had
shrugged
.
"
By
bus
to
the
village
and
then
I
walked
.
"
"
It
was
a
long
way
carrying
the
baby
.
"
"
I
'm
used
to
walking
a
long
way
carrying
the
baby
.
"
And
then
,
under
his
hesitant
questioning
,
the
story
had
come
out
,
told
by
her
without
self-pity
,
almost
,
it
had
seemed
,
without
particular
interest
,
as
if
the
events
had
happened
to
someone
else
.
It
was
not
,
he
supposed
,
an
unusual
tale
.
She
was
living
in
one
of
the
small
private
hotels
in
Cromer
on
Social
Security
.
She
had
been
in
a
squat
in
London
but
had
thought
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
some
sea
air
for
the
baby
for
the
summer
.
Only
it
was
n't
working
out
.
The
woman
at
the
hotel
did
n't
really
want
kids
and
with
summer
holidays
approaching
could
get
a
better
rate
for
her
rooms
.
She
did
n't
think
she
could
be
turned
out
,
but
she
was
n't
going
to
stay
,
not
with
that
bitch
.
He
asked
:
"
Could
n't
the
baby
's
father
help
?
"
"
He
has
n't
got
a
father
.
He
did
have
a
father
-
I
mean
,
he
is
n't
Jesus
Christ
.
But
he
has
n't
got
one
now
.
"
"
Do
you
mean
that
he
's
dead
or
that
he
's
gone
away
?
"
"
Could
be
either
,
could
n't
it
?
Look
,
if
I
knew
who
he
was
I
might
know
where
he
was
,
OK
?
"
Then
there
had
been
another
science
during
which
she
took
periodical
gulps
of
her
tea
and
the
sleeping
baby
stirred
and
gave
small
pig-like
grunts
.
After
a
few
minutes
he
had
spoken
again
.
"
Look
,
if
you
ca
n't
find
anywhere
else
in
Cromer
you
can
share
the
caravan
for
a
time
.
"
He
had
added
hastily
:
"
I
mean
,
there
is
a
second
bedroom
.
It
's
very
small
,
only
just
room
for
the
bunk
,
but
it
would
do
for
a
time
.
I
know
it
's
isolated
here
but
it
's
close
to
the
beach
which
would
be
nice
for
the
baby
.
"
She
had
turned
on
him
again
that
remarkable
glance
in
which
for
the
first
time
he
had
detected
to
his
discomfiture
a
brief
flash
of
intelligence
and
of
calculation
.
"
All
right
,
"
she
said
.
"
If
I
ca
n't
find
anywhere
else
I
'll
come
back
And
he
had
lain
awake
late
that
night
half
hoping
,
half
dreading
that
she
would
return
.
And
she
had
returned
the
following
afternoon
,
carrying
Timmy
on
her
hip
and
the
rest
of
her
possessions
in
a
backpack
.
She
had
taken
over
the
caravan
and
his
life
.
He
did
n't
know
whether
what
he
felt
for
her
was
love
,
affection
or
pity
,
or
a
mixture
of
all
three
.
He
only
knew
that
in
his
anxious
and
over-concerned
life
his
second
greatest
fear
was
that
she
might
leave
.
He
had
lived
in
the
caravan
now
for
just
over
two
years
,
supported
by
a
research
grant
from
his
northern
university
to
study
the
effect
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
on
the
rural
industries
of
East
Anglia
.
His
dissertation
was
nearly
finished
but
for
the
last
six
months
he
had
almost
stopped
work
on
it
and
had
devoted
himself
entirely
to
his
passion
,
a
crusade
against
nuclear
power
.
From
the
caravan
on
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
he
could
see
Larksoken
Power
Station
stark
against
the
skyline
,
as
uncompromising
as
his
own
will
to
oppose
it
,
a
symbol
and
a
threat
.
It
was
from
the
caravan
that
he
ran
People
Against
Nuclear
Power
,
with
its
acronym
PANUP
,
the
small
organization
of
which
he
was
both
founder
and
president
.
The
caravan
had
been
a
stroke
of
luck
.
The
owner
of
Cliff
Cottage
was
a
Canadian
who
,
returning
to
his
roots
and
seduced
by
nostalgia
,
had
bought
it
on
impulse
as
a
possible
holiday
home
.
About
fifty
years
earlier
there
had
been
a
murder
at
Cliff
Cottage
.
It
had
been
a
fairly
commonplace
murder
,
a
henpecked
husband
at
the
end
of
his
tether
who
had
taken
a
hatchet
to
his
virago
of
a
wife
.
But
if
it
had
been
neither
particularly
interesting
nor
mysterious
,
it
had
certainly
been
bloody
.
After
the
cottage
had
been
bought
the
Canadian
's
wife
had
heard
graphic
accounts
of
spilt
brains
and
blood-spattered
walls
and
had
declared
that
she
had
no
intention
of
living
there
in
summer
or
at
any
other
time
.
Its
very
isolation
,
once
attractive
,
now
appeared
both
sinister
and
repellent
.
And
to
compound
the
problem
,
the
local
planning
authority
had
shown
themselves
unsympathetic
to
the
owner
's
over-ambitious
plans
for
rebuilding
.
Disillusioned
with
the
cottage
and
its
problems
,
he
had
boarded
up
the
windows
and
returned
to
Toronto
,
meaning
eventually
to
come
back
and
make
a
final
decision
about
his
ill-advised
purchase
.
The
previous
owner
had
parked
a
large
,
old-fashioned
caravan
at
the
back
and
the
Canadian
had
made
no
difficulty
about
letting
this
to
Neil
for
two
pounds
a
week
,
seeing
it
as
a
useful
way
of
having
someone
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
property
.
And
it
was
the
caravan
,
at
once
his
home
and
his
office
,
from
which
Neil
conducted
his
campaign
.
He
tried
not
to
think
about
the
time
,
six
months
ahead
,
when
his
grant
would
finish
and
he
would
need
to
find
work
.
He
knew
that
he
had
somehow
to
stay
here
on
the
headland
,
to
keep
always
in
view
that
monstrous
building
which
dominated
his
imagination
as
it
did
his
view
.
But
now
,
to
the
uncertainty
about
his
future
funding
,
was
added
a
new
and
more
terrifying
threat
.
About
five
months
earlier
he
had
attended
an
open
day
at
the
power
station
during
which
the
Acting
Administrative
Officer
,
Hilary
Robarts
,
had
given
a
short
preliminary
talk
.
He
had
challenged
almost
everything
she
had
said
and
what
was
meant
as
an
informative
introduction
to
a
public
relations
exercise
had
developed
into
something
close
to
a
public
brawl
.
In
the
next
issue
of
his
news-sheet
he
had
reported
on
the
incident
in
terms
which
he
now
realized
had
been
unwise
.
She
had
sued
him
for
libel
.
The
action
was
due
to
be
heard
in
four
weeks
,
time
and
he
knew
that
,
successful
or
not
,
he
was
faced
with
ruin
.
Unless
she
died
in
the
next
few
weeks
-
and
why
should
she
die
?
-
it
could
be
the
end
of
his
life
on
the
headland
,
the
end
of
his
organization
,
the
end
of
all
he
had
planned
and
hoped
to
do
.
Amy
was
typing
envelopes
,
sending
out
the
final
copies
of
the
newsletter
.
A
pile
was
already
to
hand
and
he
began
folding
the
pamphlets
and
inserting
them
into
the
envelopes
.
The
job
was
n't
easy
.
He
had
tried
to
economize
with
the
size
and
quality
and
the
envelopes
were
in
danger
of
splitting
.
He
now
had
a
mailing
list
of
250
,
only
a
small
minority
of
whom
were
active
supporters
of
PANUP
.
Most
never
paid
any
dues
towards
the
organization
and
the
majority
of
the
pamphlets
went
unsolicited
to
public
authorities
,
local
firms
and
industry
in
the
vicinity
of
Larksoken
and
Sizewell
.
He
wondered
how
many
of
the
250
were
read
and
thought
,
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
anxiety
and
depression
,
of
the
total
cost
of
even
this
small
enterprise
.
And
this
month
's
newsletter
was
n't
his
best
.
Rereading
one
before
he
put
it
in
the
envelope
,
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
ill-organized
,
to
have
no
coherent
theme
.
The
principal
aim
now
was
to
refute
the
growing
argument
that
nuclear
power
could
avoid
the
damage
to
the
environment
through
the
greenhouse
effect
,
but
the
mixture
of
suggestions
ranging
from
solar
power
to
replacing
light
bulbs
with
those
which
consumed
seventy-five
per
cent
less
energy
seemed
naive
and
hardly
convincing
.
His
article
argued
that
nuclear-generated
electricity
could
n't
realistically
replace
oil
and
fossil
fuels
unless
all
nations
built
sixteen
new
reactors
a
week
in
the
five
years
from
1995
,
a
programme
impossible
to
achieve
and
one
which
,
if
practicable
,
would
add
intolerably
to
the
nuclear
threat
.
But
the
statistics
,
like
all
his
figures
,
were
culled
from
a
variety
of
sources
and
lacked
authority
.
Nothing
he
produced
seemed
to
him
genuinely
his
own
work
.
And
the
rest
of
the
newsletter
was
a
jumble
of
the
usual
scare
stories
,
most
of
which
he
had
used
before
;
allegations
of
safety
breaches
which
had
been
covered
up
,
doubts
about
the
safety
of
the
ageing
Magnox
stations
,
the
unsolved
problem
of
storing
and
transporting
nuclear
waste
.
And
this
issue
he
had
been
hard
put
to
it
to
find
a
couple
of
intelligent
letters
for
the
correspondence
page
;
sometimes
it
seemed
that
every
crackbrain
in
north-east
Norfolk
read
the
PANUP
newsletter
but
that
no
one
else
did
.
Amy
was
picking
at
the
letters
of
the
typewriter
which
had
a
persistent
tendency
to
stick
.
She
said
:

It
always
surprised
him
that
,
apparently
taking
no
account
of
him
,
she
could
yet
recall
comments
he
had
made
months
earlier
.
He
said
:

"
Lost
in
his
thoughts
,
he
hardly
realized
that
he
had
given
up
folding
the
pamphlets
.
Amy
said
:
'Look
,
if
you
're
not
going
to
help
with
these
envelopes
you
might
as
well
go
and
put
a
new
washer
on
that
tap
.
It
's
been
dripping
for
weeks
and
Timmy
's
always
falling
about
in
the
mud
.
"
"
All
right
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
'll
do
it
now
.
"
He
took
down
his
tool
kit
from
the
high
cupboard
where
it
was
kept
well
out
of
Timmy
's
reach
.
He
was
glad
to
be
out
of
the
caravan
.
It
had
become
increasingly
claustrophobic
in
the
last
few
weeks
.
Outside
he
bent
to
talk
to
Timmy
,
caged
in
his
playpen
.
He
and
Amy
had
collected
large
stones
from
the
beach
,
looking
for
those
with
holes
in
them
-
and
he
had
strung
them
on
to
strong
cord
and
tied
them
along
one
side
of
the
playpen
.
Timmy
would
spend
hours
happily
banging
them
together
or
against
the
bars
or
,
as
now
,
slobbering
against
one
of
the
stones
in
an
attempt
to
get
it
into
his
mouth
.
Sometimes
he
would
communicate
with
individual
flints
,
a
continuous
admonitory
prattle
broken
by
sudden
triumphant
squeals
.
Kneeling
down
Neil
clutched
the
bars
,
rubbed
his
nose
against
Timmy
"
s
,
and
was
rewarded
by
his
huge
,
heart-tugging
smile
.
He
looked
very
like
his
mother
with
the
same
round
head
on
a
delicate
neck
,
the
same
beautifully
shaped
mouth
.
Only
his
eyes
,
widely
spaced
,
were
differently
shaped
,
large
blue
spheres
with
,
above
them
,
straight
bushy
eyebrows
which
reminded
Neil
of
pale
and
delicate
caterpillars
.
The
tenderness
he
felt
for
the
child
was
equal
to
,
if
different
from
,
the
tenderness
he
felt
for
his
mother
.
He
could
not
now
imagine
life
on
the
headland
without
either
of
them
.
But
the
tap
defeated
him
.
Despite
his
tuggings
with
the
wrench
he
could
n't
get
the
screw
to
shift
.
Even
this
minor
domestic
task
was
apparently
beyond
his
powers
.
He
could
hear
Amy
's
derisive
voice
.
"
You
want
to
change
the
world
and
you
ca
n't
change
a
washer
.
"
After
a
couple
of
minutes
he
gave
up
the
attempt
,
left
the
tool
box
by
the
cottage
wall
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
then
slithered
down
to
the
beach
.
Crunching
over
the
ridges
of
stones
,
he
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
almost
violently
wrenched
off
his
shoes
.
It
was
thus
,
when
the
weight
of
anxiety
about
his
failed
ambitions
,
his
uncertain
future
,
became
too
heavy
that
he
would
find
his
peace
,
standing
motionless
to
watch
the
veined
curve
of
the
poised
wave
,
the
tumult
of
crashing
foam
breaking
over
his
feet
,
the
wide
intersecting
arches
washing
over
the
smooth
sand
as
the
wave
retreated
to
leave
its
tenuous
lip
of
foam
.
But
today
even
this
wonder
,
continually
repeated
,
failed
to
comfort
his
spirit
.
He
gazed
out
to
the
horizon
with
unseeing
eyes
and
thought
about
his
present
life
,
the
hopelessness
of
the
future
,
about
Amy
,
about
his
family
.
Thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pocket
,
he
felt
the
crumpled
envelope
of
his
mother
's
last
letter
.
He
knew
that
his
parents
were
disappointed
in
him
,
although
they
never
said
so
openly
since
oblique
hints
were
just
as
effective
:
"

She
certainly
did
n't
like
to
say

he
was
living
there
with
a
girl

had

"
After
the
letter
had
been
posted
.
he
had
felt
ashamed
.
The
cheap
attempt
at
humour
had
been
too
like
a
treacherous
repudiation
of
Timmy
whom
he
loved
.
And
his
mother
had
n't
found
it
either
funny
or
reassuring
.
His
letter
had
produced
an
almost
incoherent
farrago
of
warnings
,
pained
reproaches
and
veiled
references
to
the
possible
reaction
of
Mrs
Reilly
if
she
ever
got
to
know
.
Only
his
two
brothers
surreptitiously
welcomed
his
way
of
life
.
They
had
n't
made
university
and
the
difference
between
their
comfortable
life
style
-
houses
on
an
executive
estate
,
en
suite
bathrooms
,
artificial
coal
fires
in
what
they
called
the
lounge
,
working
wives
,
a
new
car
every
two
years
and
timeshares
in
Majorca
-
provided
both
with
agreeable
hours
of
self-satisfied
comparisons
which
he
knew
would
always
end
with
the
same
conclusion
,
that
he
ought
to
pull
himself
together
,
that
it
was
n't
right
,
not
after
all
the
sacrifices
Mum
and
Dad
had
made
to
send
him
to
college
,
and
a
fine
waste
of
money
that
had
proved
.
He
had
told
Amy
none
of
this
but
would
have
happily
confided
had
she
shown
the
least
interest
.
But
she
asked
no
questions
about
his
past
life
and
told
him
nothing
about
hers
.
Her
voice
,
her
body
,
her
smell
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
own
,
but
essentially
he
knew
no
more
about
her
now
than
when
she
had
arrived
.
She
refused
to
collect
any
welfare
benefits
,
saying
that
she
was
n't
going
to
have
DHSS
snoopers
visiting
the
caravan
to
see
if
she
and
Neil
were
sleeping
together
.
He
sympathized
.
He
did
n't
want
them
either
,
but
he
felt
that
for
Timmy
's
sake
she
should
take
what
was
on
offer
.
He
had
given
her
no
money
but
he
did
feed
both
of
them
,
and
this
was
difficult
enough
on
his
grant
.
No
one
visited
her
and
no
one
telephoned
.
Occasionally
she
would
receive
a
postcard
,
coloured
views
usually
of
London
with
nondescript
,
meaningless
messages
,
but
as
far
as
he
knew
she
never
replied
.
They
had
so
little
in
common
.
She
helped
spasmodically
with
PANUP
but
he
was
never
sure
how
far
she
was
actually
committed
.
And
he
knew
that
she
found
his
pacifism
stupid
.
He
could
recall
a
conversation
only
this
morning
.
"

to
be
a
beginning
of
trust

it
's
people

we
have
to
find
the
faith

open
our

my

We
inhabit
the

The
world
is
full
of
pain

we
need
n't
add
to
it

There
has
to
be
an
end

She
had
said
obstinately
:
"

n't

nothing

He
'd
keep
them

so
naive
sometimes

people

She
had
said
:
"

I
sympathize

just

demonstrating

making
their

heard

letting
the

know
that
what
they
want
is
a
peaceful
world

themselves

And
then
she
had
almost
shouted
at
him
:
"

"

do
n't
say
it
.
"
The
only
cause
they
had
in
common
was
a
refusal
to
eat
meat
.
Soon
after
she
arrived
at
the
caravan
he
had
said
:
"
I
'm
vegetarian

I

n't
expect

He
had
wondered
as
he
spoke
whether
Timmy
was
old
enough
to
eat
meat
.
He
had
added
:
"

buy
a
chop

"

"
And
Timmy
?
"
"
Timmy
has
what
I
give
him
.
He
's
not
fussy
.
"
Nor
was
he
.
Neil
could
n't
imagine
a
more
accommodating
child
nor
,
for
most
of
the
time
,
a
more
contented
one
.
He
had
found
the
second-hand
playpen
advertised
on
a
newsagent
's
board
in
Norwich
and
had
brought
it
back
on
the
top
of
the
van
.
In
it
Timmy
would
crawl
for
hours
or
pull
himself
up
and
stand
precariously
balancing
,
his
napkin
invariably
falling
about
his
knees
.
When
thwarted
he
would
rage
,
shutting
his
eyes
tight
,
opening
his
mouth
and
holding
his
breath
before
letting
out
a
bellow
of
such
terrifying
power
that
Neil
half
expected
the
whole
of
Lydsett
to
come
running
to
see
which
of
them
was
tormenting
the
child
.
Amy
never
smacked
him
but
would
jerk
him
on
to
her
hip
and
dump
him
on
her
bed
saying
:
"
Bloody
awful
noise
.
"
"
Should
n't
you
stay
with
him
?
Holding
his
breath
like
that
,
he
could
kill
himself
.
"
"
You
daft
?
He
wo
n't
kill
himself
.
They
never
do
.
"
And
he
knew
now
that
he
wanted
her
,
wanted
her
when
it
was
obvious
that
she
did
n't
want
him
and
would
never
again
risk
rejection
.
On
the
second
night
at
the
caravan
she
had
slid
back
the
partition
between
his
bed
and
hers
and
had
walked
quietly
up
to
his
bed
and
had
stood
gravely
looking
down
at
him
.
She
had
been
completely
naked
.
He
had
said
:
"
Look
,
Amy
,
you

n't

I

not

.
But

it
your
own
way
.
"
After
a
pause
she
had
said
:
"

something

"
"
No

it

about

we
slept
together

I

if
I
disappointed

"
"
Or

OK

I
expect

"
Another
pause
,
and
then
she
had
added
:
"
You
'd

then
,

I

"
"

,
"
he
said
,
"

She
had
turned
away
.
"
I
always
do
walk
out
in
the
end
.
No
one
has
ever
minded
before
.
"
It
was
the
only
sexual
advance
she
had
ever
made
to
him
and
he
knew
it
would
be
the
last
.
Now
they
slept
with
Timmy
's
cot
wedged
between
the
partition
and
his
bed
.
Sometimes
in
the
night
,
wakeful
because
the
child
had
stirred
,
he
would
put
out
his
hands
and
clasp
the
bars
and
long
to
shake
this
frail
barrier
that
symbolized
the
unbridgeable
gulf
between
them
.
She
lay
there
,
sleek
and
curved
as
a
fish
or
a
gull
,
so
close
that
he
could
hear
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
breath
faintly
echoing
the
suspiration
of
the
sea
.
His
body
ached
for
her
and
he
would
press
his
face
into
the
lumpy
pillow
groaning
with
the
hopelessness
of
his
need
.
What
could
she
possibly
see
in
him
to
make
her
want
him
,
except
,
as
on
that
one
night
,
out
of
gratitude
,
pity
,
curiosity
or
boredom
?
He
hated
his
body
,
the
scrawny
legs
on
which
the
kneecaps
protruded
like
deformities
,
the
small
blinking
eyes
too
closely
set
,
the
sparse
beard
which
could
n't
disguise
the
weakness
of
the
mouth
and
chin
.
Sometimes
,
too
,
he
was
tormented
by
jealousy
.
Without
proof
,
he
had
convinced
himself
that
there
was
someone
else
.
She
would
say
that
she
wanted
to
walk
alone
on
the
headland
.
And
he
would
watch
her
go
with
the
certainty
that
she
was
meeting
a
lover
.
And
when
she
returned
he
would
imagine
that
he
could
see
the
glow
of
the
skin
,
the
satisfied
smile
of
remembered
happiness
,
could
almost
smell
that
she
had
been
making
love
.
He
had
already
heard
from
the
university
that
his
research
grant
would
not
be
extended
.
The
decision
was
n't
surprising
;
he
had
been
warned
to
expect
it
.
He
had
been
saving
as
much
as
possible
from
the
grant
in
the
hope
of
amassing
a
small
sum
which
would
tide
him
over
until
he
could
find
a
local
job
.
It
hardly
mattered
what
.
Anything
that
would
pay
enough
to
live
and
allow
him
to
remain
on
the
headland
to
carry
on
the
campaign
.
In
theory
he
supposed
he
could
organize
PANUP
from
anywhere
in
the
UK
,
but
he
knew
that
it
was
irrevocably
bound
to
Larksoken
headland
,
to
the
caravan
,
to
that
concrete
mass
five
miles
to
the
north
which
had
power
,
apparently
,
to
dominate
his
will
as
it
did
his
imagination
.
He
had
already
put
out
feelers
with
local
employers
but
they
had
n't
been
too
keen
on
employing
a
well-known
agitator
;
even
those
who
seemed
sympathetic
to
the
anti-nuclear
cause
did
n't
actually
have
work
on
offer
.
Perhaps
they
feared
that
too
many
of
his
energies
would
be
diverted
to
the
campaign
.
And
his
small
capital
was
draining
away
with
the
extra
expense
of
Amy
,
Timmy
and
even
the
cats
.
And
now
there
was
the
threat
of
this
libel
action
,
less
of
a
threat
than
a
certainty
.
When
,
ten
minutes
later
,
he
returned
to
the
caravan
Amy
,
too
,
had
given
up
working
.
She
was
lying
on
her
bed
,
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
,
Smudge
and
Whisky
curled
on
her
stomach
.
Looking
down
at
her
,
he
said
abruptly
:
"

She
sat
up
smartly
and
stared
at

.
The
kittens
,
affronted
,
squealed
their
protest

fled

heard

And
illogically
,
he
was
,
for
the
moment
,
reassured
and
comforted
.
It
was
six
o'clock
and
at
Larksoken
Power
Station
,
the
weekly
interdepartmental
meeting
was
drawing
to
a
close
.
It
had
lasted
thirty
minutes
longer
than
usual
;
Dr
Alex
Mair
took
the
view
,
which
he
could
normally
enforce
by
brisk
chairmanship
,
that
little
original
thought
was
contributed
to
a
discussion
after
three
hours
of
talking
.
But
it
had
been
a
heavy
agenda
:
the
revised
safety
plan
still
in
draft
;
the
rationalization
of
the
internal
structure
from
the
present
seven
departments
to
three
under
engineering
,
production
and
resources
;
the
report
of
the
district
survey
laboratory
on
their
monitoring
of
the
environment
;
the
preliminary
agenda
for
the
local
liaison
committee
.
This
annual
jamboree
was
an
unwieldy
but
useful
public
relations
exercise
which
needed
careful
preparation
,
including
as
it
did
representatives
from
the
interested
government
departments
,
local
authorities
,
police
,
fire
and
water
authorities
,
the
National
Farmers
Union
and
the
Country
Landowners
'
Association
.
Mair
sometimes
grudged
the
work
and
time
it
involved
but
he
knew
its
importance
.
The
weekly
meeting
was
held
in
his
office
at
the
conference
table
set
in
front
of
the
south
window
.
Darkness
was
falling
and
the
huge
pane
of
glass
was
a
black
rectangle
in
which
he
could
see
their
faces
reflected
,
like
the
gaunt
,
disembodied
heads
of
night
travellers
in
a
lighted
railway
carriage
.
He
suspected
that
some
of
his
departmental
heads
,
particularly
BH
Morgan
,
the
Works
Office
Engineer
,
and
Stephen
Mansell
,
the
Maintenance
Superintendent
,
would
have
preferred
a
more
relaxed
setting
in
his
private
sitting
room
next
door
,
the
low
,
comfortable
chairs
,
a
few
hours
of
chat
with
no
set
agenda
,
perhaps
a
drink
together
afterwards
in
a
local
pub
.
Well
,
that
was
one
management
style
,
but
it
was
n't
his
.
Now
he
closed
the
stiff
cover
of
his
folder
in
which
his
PA
had
meticulously
tagged
all
the
papers
and
cross-references
,
and
said
dismissively
:
"
Any
other
business
.
"
But
he
was
not
allowed
to
get
away
so
easily
.
On
his
right
,
as
usual
,
sat
Miles
Lessingham
,
the
Operations
Superintendent
,
whose
reflection
,
staring
back
into
the
room
,
looked
like
a
hydrocephalic
death
's
head
.
Glancing
from
the
image
to
the
face
,
Mair
could
see
little
difference
.
The
stark
overhead
lights
threw
deep
shadows
under
the
deep-set
eyes
and
the
sweat
glistened
on
the
wide
,
rather
knobbly
forehead
with
its
swathe
of
fair
undisciplined
hair
.
Now
he
stretched
back
in
his
chair
and
said
:
"
This
proposed
job
-
rumoured
job
,
I
should
say
-
I
suppose
we
're
entitled
to
ask
whether
it
has
been
formally
offered
to
you
yet
?
Or
are
n't
we
?
"
Mair
said
calmly
:
The
answer
is
that
it
has
n't
;
the
publicity
was
premature
.
The
press
got
hold
of
it
somehow
,
as
they
usually
do
,
but
there
's
nothing
official
yet
.
One
unfortunate
result
of
our
present
habit
of
leaking
any
information
of
interest
is
that
the
people
most
concerned
become
the
last
to
know
.
If
and
when
it
is
official
you
seven
will
be
the
first
to
be
told
.
"
Lessingham
said
:
"
It
will
have
serious
implications
here
,
Alex

Maid

John

necessary
reorganization

"
Lessingham
asked
:
"
Who
will
they
appoint
,
a
director
or
a
station
manager
?
"
The
question
was
less
innocent
than
it
sounded
.
"
I
imagine
a
station
manager
.
"
"
You
mean
that
the
research
will
go

"
Mair
said
:
"
When
I
go
,
now
or
later
,
the
research
will
go
.
You
've
always
known
that
.
I
brought
it
with
me
and
I
would
n't
have
taken
the
job
if
I
could
n't
have
continued
it
here
.
I
asked
for
certain
research
facilities
and
I
got
them
.
But
research
at
Larksoken
has
always
been
somewhat
of
an
anomaly
.
We
've
done
good
work
,
are
still
doing
good
work
,
but
logically
it
should
be
done
elsewhere
,
at
Harwell
or
Winfrith
.
Is
there
any
other
business
?
"
But
Lessingham
was
not
to
be
discouraged
.
He
said
:
"
Who
will
you
be
responsible
to
?
The
Secretary
of
State
for
Energy
directly
or
the
AEA
?
"
Mair
knew
the
answer
but
had
no
intention
of
giving
it
.
He
said
quietly
:
"
That
is
still
under
discussion
.
"
"
Along

no
doubt
,
with
such
minor
matters
as

what
you
are
going
to
be
called

Power

certain
cachet

But
what
precisely
will
you
control
?
"
There
was
a
silence
.
Mair
said
:
"
If
the
answer
to
that
question
were
known

no
doubt
the
appointment

do
n't
want

discussion
,
but
had
n't
we
better
confine
it
to
matters
within
the
competence
of
this
committee
?
Right
,
is
there
any
other
business
?
"
and
this
time
there
was
no
reply
.
Hilary
Robarts
,
the
Acting
Administrative
Officer
,
had
already
closed
her
file
.
She
had
n't
taken
part
in
the
questioning
but
the
others
,
Mair
knew
,
would
assume
that
that
was
because
he
had
already
told
her
the
answers
.
Even
before
they
had
left
,
his
PA
,
Caroline
Amphlett
,
had
come
in
to
take
away
the
tea
cups
and
clear
the
table
.
Lessingham
made
it
a
habit
to
leave
his
agenda
behind
,
a
small
personal
protest
against
the
amount
of
paper
which
the
formal
weekly
meeting
generated
.
Dr
Martin
Goss
,
head
of
the
medical
physics
department
,
had
,
as
always
,
doodled
obsessively
.
His
jotting
pad
was
covered
with
hot-air
balloons
,
intricately
patterned
and
decorated
;
part
of
his
mind
had
obviously
been
with
his
private
passion
.
Caroline
Amphlett
moved
,
as
always
,
with
a
quiet
,
efficient
grace
.
Neither
spoke
.
She
had
worked
for
Mair
as
his
PA
for
the
last
three
years
and
he
knew
her
now
no
better
than
on
that
morning
when
she
had
sat
in
this
same
office
being
interviewed
for
the
job
.
She
was
a
tall
,
blonde
girl
,
smooth-skinned
with
wide-spaced
,
rather
small
eyes
of
an
extraordinary
deep
blue
,
who
would
have
been
thought
beautiful
if
she
had
shown
more
animation
.
Mair
suspected
that
she
used
her
confidential
job
as
his
PA
to
preserve
a
deliberately
intimidating
reserve
.
She
was
the
most
efficient
secretary
he
had
ever
had
and
it
irked
him
that
she
had
made
it
clear
that
,
if
and
when
he
moved
,
she
would
wish
to
stay
at
Larksoken
.
She
had
told
him
that
her
reasons
were
personal
.
That
,
of
course
,
meant
Jonathan
Reeves
,
a
junior
engineer
in
the
workshop
.
He
had
been
as
surprised
and
chagrined
at
her
choice
as
he
had
at
the
prospect
of
taking
up
a
new
job
with
an
unknown
PA
,
but
there
had
been
an
additional
and
more
disturbing
reaction
.
Hers
was
not
a
type
of
female
beauty
which
attracted
him
and
he
had
always
assumed
that
she
was
physically
cold
.
It
was
disconcerting
to
think
that
an
acned
nonenity
had
discovered
and
perhaps
explored
depths
which
he
,
in
their
daily
intimacy
,
had
n't
even
suspected
.
He
had
sometimes
wondered
,
although
with
little
real
curiosity
,
whether
she
might
not
be
less
compliant
,
more
complicated
than
he
had
supposed
,
had
occasionally
had
a
disconcerting
sense
that
the
facade
she
presented
to
the
power
station
of
dedicated
,
humourless
efficiency
had
been
carefully
constructed
to
conceal
a
less
accommodating
,
more
complex
personality
.
But
if
the
real
Caroline
was
accessible
to
Jonathan
Reeves
,
if
she
really
liked
and
wanted
that
unprepossessing
wimp
,
then
she
hardly
merited
the
tribute
even
of
his
curiosity
.
He
gave
his
departmental
heads
time
to
get
back
to
their
offices
before
he
rang
for
Hilary
Robarts
and
asked
her
to
come
back
.
It
would
have
been
more
usual
to
have
asked
her
with
careful
casualness
to
wait
behind
after
the
meeting
but
what
he
had
to
say
was
private
and
he
had
been
trying
for
some
weeks
now
to
cut
down
the
number
of
times
when
they
were
known
to
be
alone
together
.
He
was
n't
looking
forward
to
the
interview
.
She
would
see
what
he
had
to
say
as
personal
criticism
and
that
was
something
which
in
his
experience
few
women
could
take
.
He
thought
:
She
was
my
mistress
once
.
I
was
in
love
with
her
,
as
much
in
love
as
I
thought
I
was
capable
of
being
.
And
if
it
was
n't
love
,
whatever
that
word
means
,
at
least
I
wanted
her
.
Will
that
make
what
I
have
to
say
easier
or
more
difficult
?
He
told
himself
that
all
men
were
cowards
when
it
came
to
a
showdown
with

That
first
post-natal
subservience
,
bred
of
physical
dependence

ingrained
ever
to
be
totally
eradicated
.
He
was
n't
more
cowardly
than
the
rest
of
his
sex

was
it

overheard

the
Lydsett

first
four
weeks

He
stood
up
when
she
came
in
and
waited
until
she
had
taken
the
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
.
Then
he
opened
the
right-hand
drawer
and
took
out
a
duplicated
news-sheet

he
slid
across
the
desk
towards
her

She
gave
it
a
brief
glance

then
pushed
it
back

desk

took

up
and
read

"
Many
readers
will
probably
have
learned
by
now
that
I
am
being
sued
by
Miss
Hilary
Robarts
,
the
Acting
Administrative
Officer
at
Larksoken
Power
Station
,
for
alleged
libel
arising
from
what
I
wrote
in
the
May
issue
of
the
news-sheet
.
I
shall
,
of
course
,
strenuously
defend
the
action
and
,
as
I
have
no
money
to
pay
for
a
lawyer
,
will
present
my
own
defence
.
This
is
just
the
latest
example
of
the
threat
to
free
information
and
even
free
speech
presented
by
the
nuclear
energy
lobby
.
Apparently
now
even
the
mildest
criticism
is
to
be
followed
by
the
threat
of
legal
action
.
But
there
is
a
positive
side
.
This
action
by
Hilary
Robarts
shows
that
we
,
the
ordinary
people
of
this
county
,
are
making
our
impact
.
Would
they
bother
with
our
small
news-sheet
if
they
were
n't
running
scared
?
And
the
libel
action
,
if
it
comes
to
trial
,
will
give
us
valuable
national
publicity
if
properly
handled
.
We
are
stronger
than
we
know
.
Meanwhile
I
give
below
the
dates
of
the
next
open
days
at
Larksoken
so
that
as
many
of
us
as
possible
can
attend
and
strenuously
put
our
case
against
nuclear
power
during
the
question
time
which
normally
precedes
the
actual
tour
of
the
station
.
"
She
said
:
"
I
told
you

've
seen

your
time

it
out

He
seems
determined
to
aggravate
his
offence
.
If
he
had
any
sense
he

himself

good
lawyer

keep
his
mouth
shut

"
He

able
to

damages
.
"
He
paused
,
and
then
said
quietly
:
"
In
the
interests

You
'll
get
nothing
out

"
"
He
is
to
me

What
he
describes
as
mild
criticism
was
a
serious
libel
and
it
was
widely
disseminated
.
There
's
no
defence
.
Remember
the
actual
words
?
"
A
woman
whose
response
to

is
that
only
thirty-one
people

killed

can
dismiss
as
unimportant

of
the
world

thousands

in
deaths
from

fifty

totally
unsuitable

be
trusted

work
in
an
atomic
power
station
.
While
she
remains
there
,
in
any
capacity
,
we
must
have
the
gravest
doubts
whether
safety
will
ever
be
taken
seriously
at
Larksoken
.
'
"
That
's
a
clear
allegation

professional
incompetence

away
with
that
,
we
'll
never
get
rid

He
paused
,
detecting
in
his
voice
the
first
trace
of
that
reedy
mixture
of
sarcasm
and
pomposity
which
he
knew
occasionally
affected
him
and
to
which
he
was
morbidly
sensitive

He
went
on

While
he
was
speaking
she
got
up
and
began
pacing
to
and
fro
across
the
wide
office

she
paused

could

was
striding
to

He
got

walked
over
to
the
window
hearing
the
angry
voice

no
longer
having
to
face
her

watching
the
reflection

her
pacing
figure
,
the
swirling
hair

turned
and
walked
back
to

He
said
calmly
:
"
All
right

my
opinion

ill-advised

into
the
eyes
in
which
,
to
his
discomfort
,
he
saw
more
pain
than
anger

He
said

He
knew
that
this
was
the
moment
when
he
should
have
said
firmly
:
"
I
may
be
moving
to
London
,
but
not
with
you

"
But
he
found
it
impossible

He
told
himself
that
it
was
late
,
the
end
of
a
busy
day
,
the
worst
possible
time
for
rational
argument
.
She
was
already
overwrought
.
One
thing
at
a
time
.
He
had
tackled
her
about
Pascoe
and
,
although
she
had
reacted
much
as
he
'd
expected
,
perhaps
she
would
think
it
over
and
do
what
he
advised
.
And
she
was
right
about
Ryan
Blaney
;
it
was
none
of
his
business
.
The
interview
had
left
him
with
two
clear
intentions
more
firmly
fixed
than
ever
in
his
mind
.
She
was
n't
coming
to
London
with
him
and
nor
would
he
recommend
her
as
Administrative
Officer
at
Larksoken
.
For
all
her
efficiency
,
her
intelligence
,
her
appropriate
education
,
she
was
n't
the
right
person
for
the
job
.
For
a
moment
it
crossed
his
mind
that
here
was
his
bargaining
card
.
"
I
'm
not
offering
you
marriage

I
am
offering
you
the
most
senior
job

possibly
aspire
to

But
he
knew
there
was
no
real
temptation
.
He
would
n't
leave
the
administration
of
Larksoken
in
her
hands
.
Sooner
or
later
she
was
going
to
have
to
realize
that
there
would
be
no
marriage
and
no
promotion
.
But
now
was
the
wrong
moment
and
he
found
himself
wondering
wryly
when
the
right
moment
might
be
.
Instead
he
said
:
"

He

He
's
dishonest
and
he
's

Look
how
he
scrubs
around
in
the
records
to
turn
up
individual
cases
of
leukaemia
which
he
thinks
he
can
ascribe
to
nuclear
energy
.
And
now
he
's
got
the
latest
Comare

to
fuel
his
spurious
concern
.
And
what
about
last
month
's

,
that
emotive
nonsense
about
the
midnight
trains
of
death
trundling
silently
through
the
northern
suburbs
of
London
?
Anyone
would
think
they
were
carrying
open

Does
n't
he
care

saved
the
world

about

buried
alive

She
's
demanding
from
me
a
commitment
to
something
more
personal
than
atomic
Power
.
Turning
to
face
her
,
he
was
visited
suddenly
,
not
by
desire
,
but
by
a
memory
,
inconveniently
intense
,
of
the
desire
he
had
once
felt
for
her
.
And
with
memory
came
a
sudden
vivid
picture
of
them
together
in
her
cottage
,
the
heavy
breasts
bent
over
him
,
her
hair
falling
across
his
face
,
her
lips
,
her
hands
,
her
thighs
.
He
said
roughly
:
"
If

are
plenty

All
right
the

I
doubt
whether
that
impotent
old

up

Old

has
much

The
telephone
on
his
desk
rang
.
Caroline
Amphlett
had
left
and
it
was
switched
through
to
an
outside
line
.
As
he
lifted
the
receiver
he
saw
that
Hilary
was
standing
at
the
door
.
She
gave
him
a
last
long
look
and
went
out
,
shutting
it
with
unnecessary
firmness
behind
her
.
The
caller
was
his
sister
.
She
said
:
"

He
was

calmly
as
she
had
spoken

the

five

How
did
you
manage
it

"
"
By
the
expedient
of
asking
.
I
imagine
he
may
be
thinking
of
keeping
on
the
mill
as
a
holiday
home
and
feels
it
's
time
to
acknowledge
that
he
does
have
neighbours
.
Or
he
may
be
planning
to
sell
,
in
which
case
he
can
risk
a
dinner
party
without
being
trapped
into
intimacy
.
But
why
not
give
him
credit
for
a
simple
human
weakness
;
the
attraction
of
eating
a
good
dinner
which
he
has
n't
had

cook

"
And
it
would
balance
her
table
,
thought
Mair
,
although
that
was
hardly
likely
to
have
been
a
consideration

She
despised
the
Noah

Ark
convention
which
decreed
that
a
superfluous
man

however
unattractive

stupid
,
was
acceptable
;
a
superfluous
woman

however
witty

well-informed
,
a
social
embarrassment

He
smiled
as
he
replaced
the
receiver
.
His
sister
invariably
had
the
power
to
restore
him
to
good
humour
.
Before
leaving
he
stood
for
a
moment
at
the
door
and
let
his
eyes
range
round
the
room
as
if
he
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time
.
He
was
ambitious
for
the
new
job
,
had
cleverly
planned
and
schemed
to
get
it
.
And
now
,
when
it
was
almost
his
,
he
realized
how
much
he
would
miss
Larksoken
,
its
remoteness
,
its
bleak
uncompromising
strength
.
Nothing
had
been
done
to
prettify
the
site
as
at
Sizewell
,
on
the
Suffolk
coast
,
or
to
produce
the
pleasantly
laid-out
grounds
of
smooth
lawn
,
flowering
trees
and
shrubs
which
so
agreeably
impressed
him
on
his
periodic
visits
to
Winfrith
in
Dorset
.
A
low
,
curving
wall
faced
with
flint
had
been
built
on
the
seaward
boundary
behind
whose
shelter
every
spring
a
bright
ribbon
of
daffodils
strained
and
tossed
in
the
March
winds
.
Little
else
had
been
done
to
harmonize
or
soften
the
concrete
's
grey
immensity
.
But
this
was
what
he
liked
,
the
wide
expanse
of
turbulent
sea
,
browny-grey
,
white-laced
under
a
limitless
sky
,
windows
which
he
could
open
so
that
,
at
a
touch
of
his
hand
,
the
faint
continuous
boom
like
distant
thunder
would
instantaneously
pour
into
his
office
in
a
roar
of
crashing
billows
.
He
liked
best
the
stormy
winter
evenings
when
,
working
late
,
he
could
see
the
lights
of
shipping
prinking
the
horizon
as
they
made
their
way
down
the
coast
to
the
Yarmouth
lanes
,
and
see
the
flashing
lightships
and
the
beam
from
Happisburgh
Lighthouse
,
which
for
generations
had
warned
mariners
of
the
treacherous
offshore
sands
.
Even
on
the
darkest
night
,
by
the
light
which
the
sea
seemed
mysteriously
to
absorb
and
reflect
,
he
could
make
out
the
splendid
fifteenth-century
west
tower
of
Happisburgh
Church
,
that
embattled
symbol
of
man
's
precarious
defences
against
this
most
dangerous
of
seas
.
And
it
was
a
symbol
of
more
than
that
.
The
tower
must
have
been
the
last
sight
of
land
for
hundreds
of
drowning
mariners
in
peace
and
war
.
His
mind
,
always
tenacious
of
facts
,
could
recall
the
details
at
will
.
The
crew
of
HMS
Peggy
,
driven
ashore
on
19
December
1770
,
the
119
members
of
HMS
Invincible
wrecked
on
the
sands
on
13
March
1801
when
on
her
way
to
join
Nelson
's
fleet
at
Copenhagen
,
the
crew
of
HMS
Hunter
,
the
revenue
cutter
,
lost
in
1804
,
many
of
their
crews
buried
under
the
grassy
mounds
in
Happisburgh
Churchyard
.
Built
in
an
age
of
faith
,
the
tower
had
stood
as
a
symbol
,
too
,
of
that
final
unquenchable
hope
that
even
the
sea
would
yield
up
her
dead
and
that
their
God
was
God
of
the
waters
as
he
was
of
the
land
.
But
now
mariners
could
see
,
dwarfing
the
tower
,
the
huge
rectangular
bulk
of
Larksoken
Power
Station
.
For
those
who
sought
symbols
in
inanimate
objects
its
message
was
both
simple
and
expedient
,
that
man
,
by
his
own
intelligence
and
his
own
efforts
,
could
understand
and
master
his
world
,
could
make
his
transitory
life
more
agreeable
,
more
comfortable
,
more
free
of
pain
.
For
him
this
was
challenging
enough
,
and
if
he
had
needed
a
faith
to
live
by
it
would
have
been
starkly
sufficient
.
But
sometimes
,
on
the
darkest
nights
,
when
the
waves
pounded
the
shingle
like
bursts
of
distant
gunfire
,
both
the
science
and
the
symbol
would
seem
to
him
as
transitory
as
those
drowned
lives
and
he
would
find
himself
wondering
if
this
great
hulk
would
one
day
yield
to
the
sea
,
like
the
wave-smashed
concrete
from
the
last
war
defences
,
and
like
them
become
a
broken
symbol
of
man
's
long
history
on
this
desolate
coast
.
Or
would
it
resist
even
time
and
the
North
Sea
and
still
be
standing
when
the
final
darkness
fell
over
the
planet
?
In
his
more
pessimistic
moments
some
rogue
part
of
his
mind
knew
this
darkness
to
be
inevitable
,
although
he
did
not
expect
it
to
come
in
his
time
,
maybe
not
even
in
his
son
's
.
He
would
sometimes
smile
wryly
,
telling
himself
that
he
and
Neil
Pascoe
,
on
different
sides
,
would
understand
each
other
well
.
The
only
difference
was
that
one
of
them
had
hope
.
Jane
Dalgliesh
had
bought
Larksoken
Mill
five
years
earlier
when
she
had
moved
from
her
previous
home
on
the
Suffolk
coast
.
The
mill
,
which
was
built
in
1525
,
was
a
picturesque
brick
tower
,
four
storeys
high
with
an
octagonal
dome
cap
and
skeleton
fantail
.
It
had
been
converted
some
years
before
Miss
Dalgliesh
had
bought
it
by
the
addition
of
a
flint-faced
,
two-storey
building
with
a
large
sitting
room
,
smaller
study
and
a
kitchen
on
the
ground
floor
and
three
bedrooms
,
two
of
them
with
their
own
bathrooms
,
on
the
floor
above
.
Dalgliesh
had
never
asked
her
why
she
had
moved
to
Norfolk
but
he
guessed
that
the
mill
's
main
attraction
had
been
its
remoteness
,
its
closeness
to
notable
bird
sanctuaries
and
the
impressive
view
of
headland
,
sky
and
sea
from
the
top
storey
.
Perhaps
she
had
intended
to
restore
it
to
working
order
but
with
increasing
age
had
n't
been
able
to
summon
the
energy
or
enthusiasm
to
cope
with
the
disturbance
.
He
had
inherited
it
as
an
agreeable
but
mildly
onerous
responsibility
,
together
with
her
considerable
fortune
.
The
origin
of
that
had
only
become
plain
after
her
death
.
It
had
originally
been
left
to
her
by
a
noted
amateur
ornithologist
and
eccentric
with
whom
she
had
been
friendly
for
many
years
.
Whether
the
relationship
had
gone
beyond
friendship
Dalgliesh
would
now
never
know
.
She
had
,
apparently
,
spent
little
of
the
money
on
herself
,
had
been
a
dependable
benefactress
of
the
few
eccentric
charities
of
which
she
approved
,
had
remembered
them
in
her
will
,
but
without
egregious
generosity
,
and
had
left
the
residue
of
her
estate
to
him
without
explanation
,
admonition
or
peculiar
protestations
of
affection
,
although
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
words
"
my
dearly
beloved
nephew
"
meant
exactly
what
they
said
.
He
had
liked
her
,
respected
her
,
had
always
been
at
ease
in
her
company
,
but
he
had
never
thought
that
he
really
knew
her
,
and
now
he
never
would
.
He
was
a
little
surprised
how
much
he
minded
.
The
only
change
she
had
made
to
the
property
was
to
build
a
garage
,
and
after
he
had
unloaded
and
put
away
the
Jaguar
he
decided
to
climb
to
the
top
chamber
of
the
mill
while
it
was
still
light
.
The
bottom
room
,
with
Its
two
huge
grinding-wheels
of
burr-granite
propped
against
the
wall
and
its
lingering
smell
of
flour
,
still
held
an
air
of
mystery
,
of
time
held
in
abeyance
,
of
a
place
bereft
of
its
purpose
and
meaning
,
so
that
he
never
entered
it
without
a
slight
sense
of
desolation
.
There
were
only
ladders
between
the
floors
and
,
as
he
grasped
the
rungs
,
he
saw
again
his
aunt
's
long
trousered
legs
ahead
of
him
disappearing
into
the
chamber
above
.
She
had
used
only
the
top
room
of
the
mill
which
she
had
furnished
simply
with
a
small
writing
table
and
chair
facing
the
North
Sea
,
a
telephone
and
her
binoculars
.
Entering
it
he
could
imagine
her
sitting
there
in
the
summer
days
and
evenings
,
working
on
the
papers
which
she
occasionally
contributed
to
ornithological
journals
and
looking
up
from
time
to
time
to
gaze
out
over
the
headland
to
the
sea
and
the
far
horizon
,
could
see
again
that
carved
,
weather-browned
Aztec
face
with
its
hooded
eyes
under
the
grey-black
hair
,
drawn
back
into
a
bun
,
could
hear
again
a
voice
which
,
for
him
,
had
been
one
of
the
most
beautiful
female
voices
he
had
ever
heard
.
Now
it
was
late
afternoon
and
the
headland
lay
enriched
by
the
mellow
afternoon
light
,
the
sea
a
wide
expanse
of
wrinkled
blue
with
a
painter
's
stroke
of
purple
laid
on
the
horizon
.
The
colours
and
shapes
were
intensified
by
the
sun
's
last
strong
rays
so
that
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
looked
unreal
,
a
golden
fantasy
against
the
blue
of
the
sea
,
and
the
dry
grass
gleamed
as
richly
as
a
lush
water
meadow
.
There
was
a
window
at
each
of
the
compass
points
,
and
,
binoculars
in
hand
,
he
made
his
slow
perambulation
.
To
the
west
his
eyes
could
travel
along
the
narrow
road
between
the
reed
beds
and
the
dykes
to
the
flint-walled
and
Dutch-gabled
cottages
and
the
pantiled
roofs
of
Lydsett
village
and
the
round
tower
of
St
Andrew
's
Church
.
To
the
north
the
view
was
dominated
by
the
huge
bulk
of
the
power
station
,
the
low-roofed
administration
block
with
,
behind
it
,
the
reactor
building
and
the
great
steel
,
aluminium-clad
building
of
the
turbine
house
.
Four
hundred
metres
out
to
sea
were
the
rigs
and
platforms
of
the
intake
structures
through
which
the
cooling
sea
water
passed
to
the
pump
house
and
the
circulating
water
pumps
.
He
moved
again
to
the
eastern
window
and
looked
out
over
the
cottages
of
the
headland
.
Far
to
the
south
he
could
just
glimpse
the
roof
of
Scudder
's
Cottage
.
Directly
to
his
left
the
flint
walls
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
glistened
like
marbles
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
less
than
half
a
mile
to
the
north
,
set
back
among
the
Californian
pines
which
fringed
that
part
of
the
coast
,
was
the
dull
square
cottage
rented
by
Hilary
Robarts
,
a
neatly
proportional
suburban
villa
incongruously
set
down
on
this
bleak
headland
and
facing
inland
as
if
resolutely
ignoring
the
sea
.
Further
inland
,
and
only
just
visible
from
the
southern
window
was
the
Old
Rectory
,
set
like
a
Victorian
dolls
'
house
in
its
large
,
overgrown
garden
which
,
at
this
distance
,
looked
as
neatly
green
and
formal
as
a
municipal
park
.
The
telephone
rang
.
The
strident
peal
was
unwelcome
.
It
was
to
get
away
from
such
intrusions
that
he
had
come
to
Larksoken
.
But
the
call
was
not
unexpected
.
It
was
Terry
Rickards
saying
that
he
would
like
to
drop
in
for
a
chat
with
Mr
Dalgliesh
if
it
would
n't
be
too
much
bother
and
would
nine
be
convenient
?
Dalgliesh
was
unable
to
think
of
a
single
excuse
why
it
should
n't
be
.
Ten
minutes
later
he
left
the
tower
,
locking
the
door
after
him
.
This
precaution
was
a
small
act
of
piety
.
His
aunt
had
always
kept
the
door
locked
,
fearing
that
children
might
venture
into
the
mill
and
hurt
themselves
by
tumbling
down
the
ladders
.
Leaving
the
tower
to
its
darkness
and
its
solitude
,
he
went
into
Mill
Cottage
to
unpack
and
get
his
supper
.
The
huge
sitting
room
with
its
York
stone
floor
,
rugs
and
open
fireplace
was
a
comfortable
and
nostalgic
mixture
of
the
old
and
the
new
.
Most
of
the
furniture
was
familiar
to
him
from
boyhood
visits
to
his
grandparents
,
inherited
by
his
aunt
as
the
last
of
her
generation
.
Only
the
music
centre
and
the
television
set
were
comparatively
new
.
Music
had
been
important
to
her
and
the
shelves
held
a
catholic
collection
of
records
with
which
he
could
refresh
or
console
himself
during
the
two
weeks
'
holiday
.
And
next
door
,
the
kitchen
contained
nothing
superfluous
but
everything
necessary
to
a
woman
who
enjoyed
food
but
preferred
to
cook
it
with
a
minimum
of
fuss
.
He
put
a
couple
of
lamb
chops
under
the
grill
,
made
a
green
salad
and
prepared
to
enjoy
a
few
hours
of
solitude
before
the
intrusion
of
Rickards
and
his
preoccupations
.
It
still
surprised
him
a
little
that
his
aunt
had
finally
bought
a
television
set
.
Had
she
been
seduced
into
conformity
by
the
excellence
of
the
natural
history
programmes
and
then
,
like
other
late
converts
he
had
known
,
sat
captive
to
virtually
every
offering
as
if
making
up
for
lost
time
?
That
at
least
seemed
unlikely
.
He
switched
on
to
see
if
the
set
was
still
working
.
A
jerking
pop
star
was
wielding
his
guitar
as
the
credits
rolled
,
his
parodic
sexual
gyrations
so
grotesque
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
that
even
the
besotted
young
could
find
them
erotic
.
Switching
off
,
Dalgliesh
looked
up
at
the
oil
portrait
of
his
maternal
great-grandfather
,
the
Victorian
bishop
,
robed
but
unmitred
,
his
arms
in
their
billowing
lawn
sleeves
confidently
resting
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
.
He
had
an
impulse
to
say
,
"
This
is
the
music
of
1988
;
these
are
our
heroes
;
that
building
on
the
headland
is
our
architecture
and
I
dare
not
stop
my
car
to
help
children
home
because
they
've
been
taught
with
good
reason
that
a
strange
man
might
abduct
and
rape
them
.
"
He
could
have
added
,
"
And
out
there
somewhere
is
a
mass
murderer
who
enjoys
strangling
women
and
stuffing
their
mouths
with
their
hair
.
"
But
that
aberration
,
at
least
,
was
independent
of
changing
fashions
and
his
great-grandfather
would
have
had
his
scrupulous
but
uncompromising
answer
to
it
.
And
with
reason
.
After
all
,
had
n't
he
been
consecrated
bishop
in
1880
,
the
year
of
Jack
the
Ripper
?
And
probably
he
would
have
found
the
Whistler
more
understandable
than
the
pop
star
whose
gyrations
would
surely
have
convinced
him
that
man
was
in
the
grip
of
his
final
,
manic
St
Vitus
's
dance
.
Rickards
came
promptly
on
time
.
It
was
precisely
nine
when
Dalgliesh
heard
his
car
and
,
opening
the
door
on
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
saw
his
tall
figure
striding
towards
him
.
Dalgliesh
had
n't
seen
him
for
more
than
ten
years
when
he
had
been
a
newly
appointed
inspector
in
the
Metropolitan
CID
and
was
surprised
to
see
how
little
he
had
changed
;
time
,
marriage
,
removal
from
London
,
promotion
,
had
left
no
apparent
mark
on
him
.
His
rangy
,
graceless
figure
,
over
six
feet
high
,
still
looked
as
incongruous
in
a
formal
suit
as
it
always
had
.
The
rugged
,
weatherbeaten
face
,
with
its
look
of
dependable
fortitude
,
would
have
looked
more
appropriate
above
a
seaman
's
guernsey
,
preferably
with
RNLI
woven
across
the
chest
.
In
profile
his
face
,
with
the
long
,
slightly
hooked
nose
and
jutting
eyebrows
,
was
impressive
.
In
full
face
the
nose
was
revealed
as
a
little
too
wide
and
flattened
at
the
base
and
the
dark
eyes
,
which
when
he
was
animated
took
on
a
fierce
,
almost
manic
gleam
,
in
repose
were
pools
of
puzzled
endurance
.
Dalgliesh
thought
of
him
as
a
type
of
police
officer
less
common
than
formerly
but
still
not
rare
;
the
conscientious
and
incorruptible
detective
of
limited
imagination
and
somewhat
greater
intelligence
who
had
never
supposed
that
the
evil
of
the
world
should
be
condoned
because
it
was
frequently
inexplicable
and
its
perpetrators
unfortunate
.
He
gazed
round
the
sitting
room
at
the
long
wall
of
books
,
the
crackling
wood
fire
,
the
oil
of
the
Victorian
prelate
above
the
mantelshelf
as
if
deliberately
impressing
each
item
on
his
mind
,
then
sank
into
his
chair
and
stretched
out
his
long
legs
with
a
small
grunt
of
satisfaction
.
Dalgliesh
remembered
that
he
had
always
drunk
beer
;
now
he
accepted
whisky
but
said
he
could
do
with
coffee
first
.
One
habit
at
least
had
changed
.
He
said
:
"
I
'm
sorry
that
you
wo
n't
be
meeting
Susie
,
my
wife
,
while
you
're
here
,
Mr
Dalgliesh
.
She
's
having
our
first
baby
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
she
's
gone
to
stay
with
her
mother
in
York
.
Ma-in-law
did
n't
like
the
idea
of
her
being
in
Norfolk
with
the
Whistler
on
the
prowl
,
not
with
me
working
the
hours
I
do
.
"
It
was
said
with
a
kind
of
embarrassed
formality
as
if
he
,
not
Dalgliesh
,
were
the
host
and
he
was
apologizing
for
the
unexpected
absence
of
the
hostess
.
He
added
:
"
I
suppose
it
's
natural
for
an
only
daughter
to
want
to
be
with
her
mother
at
a
time
like
this
,
particularly
with
a
first
baby
.
"
Dalgliesh
's
wife
had
n't
wanted
to
be
with
her
mother
,
she
had
wanted
to
be
with
him
,
had
wanted
it
with
such
intensity
that
he
had
wondered
afterwards
whether
she
might
have
felt
a
premonition
.
He
could
remember
that
,
although
he
could
no
longer
recall
her
face
.
His
memory
of
her
,
which
for
years
,
a
traitor
to
grief
and
to
their
love
,
he
had
resolutely
tried
to
suppress
because
the
pain
had
seemed
unbearable
,
had
gradually
been
replaced
by
a
boyish
,
romantic
dream
of
gentleness
and
beauty
now
fixed
for
ever
beyond
the
depredation
of
time
.
His
newborn
son
's
face
he
could
still
recall
vividly
and
sometimes
did
in
his
dreams
,
that
white
unsullied
look
of
sweet
knowledgeable
contentment
,
as
if
,
in
a
brief
moment
of
life
,
he
had
seen
and
known
all
there
was
to
know
,
seen
it
and
rejected
it
.
He
told
himself
that
he
was
the
last
man
who
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
advise
or
reassure
on
the
problems
of
pregnancy
and
he
sensed
that
Rickards
's
unhappiness
at
his
wife
's
absence
went
deeper
than
missing
her
company
.
He
made
the
usual
inquiries
about
her
health
and
escaped
into
the
kitchen
to
make
the
coffee
.
Whatever
mysterious
spirit
had
unlocked
the
verse
,
it
had
freed
him
for
other
human
satisfactions
,
for
love
;
or
was
it
the
other
way
around
?
Had
love
unlocked
the
verse
?
It
seemed
even
to
have
affected
his
job
.
Grinding
the
coffee
beans
he
pondered
life
's
smaller
ambiguities
.
When
the
poetry
had
n't
come
,
the
job
too
had
seemed
not
only
irksome
but
occasionally
repellent
.
Now
he
was
happy
enough
to
let
Rickards
impose
on
his
solitude
to
use
him
as
a
sounding
board
.
This
new
benignity
and
tolerance
a
little
disconcerted
him
.
Success
in
moderation
was
no
doubt
better
for
the
character
than
failure
but
too
much
of
it
and
he
would
lose
his
cutting
edge
.
And
five
minutes
later
,
carrying
in
the
two
mugs
and
settling
back
in
his
chair
,
he
could
relish
the
contrast
between
Rickards
's
preoccupation
with
psychopathic
violence
and
the
peace
of
the
mill
.
The
wood
fire
,
now
past
its
crackling
stage
,
had
settled
into
a
comfortable
glow
and
the
wind
,
seldom
absent
from
the
headland
,
moved
like
a
benign
,
gently
hissing
spirit
through
the
still
and
soaring
clappers
of
the
mill
.
He
was
glad
that
it
was
n't
his
job
to
catch
the
Whistler
.
Of
all
murders
serial
killings
were
the
most
frustrating
,
the
most
difficult
and
the
chanciest
to
solve
,
the
investigation
carried
on
under
the
strain
of
vociferous
public
demand
that
the
terrifying
unknown
devil
be
caught
and
exorcized
for
ever
.
But
this
was
n't
his
case
;
he
could
discuss
it
with
the
detachment
of
a
man
who
has
a
professional
interest
but
no
responsibility
.
And
he
could
understand
what
Rickards
needed
;
not
advice
-
he
knew
his
job
-
.
but
someone
he
could
trust
,
someone
who
understood
the
language
,
someone
who
would
afterwards
be
gone
,
who
would
n't
remain
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
his
uncertainties
,
a
fellow
professional
to
whom
he
could
comfortably
think
aloud
.
He
had
his
team
and
he
was
too
punctilious
not
to
share
his
thinking
with
them
.
But
he
was
a
man
who
needed
to
articulate
his
theories
and
here
he
could
put
them
forward
,
embroider
,
reject
,
explore
without
the
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
his
detective
sergeant
,
deferentially
listening
,
his
face
carefully
expressionless
,
would
be
thinking
,
For
God
's
sake
,
what
's
the
old
man
dreaming
up
now
?
Or
,
The
old
man
's
getting
fanciful

we
do

He
started
fifteen
months
ago
.
The
first
victim
was
found
just
after
midnight
in
a
shelter
at
the
end
of
the
Easthaven
promenade
,
the
local
tart
,
incidentally
,
although
he
may
not
have
known
or
cared
.
It
was
eight
months
before
he
struck
again
.
Struck
lucky
,
I
suppose
he
'd
say
.
This
time
a
thirty-year-old
schoolteacher
cycling
home
to
Hunstanton
who
had
a
puncture
on
a
lonely
stretch
of
road
.
Then
another
gap
,
just
six
months
,
before
he
got
a
barmaid
from
Ipswich
who
'd
been
visiting
her
granny
and
was
daft
enough
to
wait
alone
for
the
late
bus
.
When
it
arrived
there
was
no
one
at
the
stop
.
A
couple
of
local
youths
got
off
.
They
'd
had
a
skinful
so
were
n't
in
a
particularly
noticing
mood
but
they
saw
and
heard
nothing
,
nothing
except
what
they
described
as
a
kind
of
mournful
whistling
coming
from
deep
in
the
wood
.
"
He
took
a
gulp
of
his
coffee
,
then
went
on
:
"
We
've
got
a
personality
assessment
from
the
trick-cyclist
.
I
do
n't
know
why
we
bother
.
I
could
have
written
it
myself
.
He
tells
us
to
look
for
a
loner
,
probably
from
a
disturbed
family
background
,
may
have
a
dominant
mother
,
does
n't
relate
easily
to
people
,
particularly
women
,
could
be
impotent
,
unmarried
,
separated
or
divorced
,
with
a
resentment
and
hatred
of
the
opposite
sex
.
Well
,
we
hardly
expect
him
to
be
a
successful
,
happily
married
bank
manager
with
four
lovely
kids
just
coming
up
to
GCE
or
whatever
they
call
it
now
.
They
're
the
devil
,
these
serial
murders
.
No
motive
-
no
motive
that
a
sane
man
can
understand
anyway
-
and
he
could
come
from
anywhere
,
Norwich
,
Ipswich
,
even
London
.
It
's
dangerous
to
assume
that
he
's
necessarily
working
in
his
own
territory
.
Looks
like
it
,
though
.
He
obviously
knows
the
locality
well
.
And
he
seems
to
be
sticking
now
to
the
same
MO
.
He
chooses
a
road
intersection
,
drives
the
car
or
van
into
the
side
of
one
road
,
cuts
across
and
waits
at
the
other
.
Then
he
drags
his
victim
into
the
bushes
or
the
trees
,
kills
and
cuts
back
to
the
other
road
and
the
car
and
makes
his
getaway
.
With
the
last
three
murders
it
seems
to
have
been
pure
chance
that
a
suitable
victim
did
,
in
fact
,
come
along
.
"
Dalgliesh
felt
that
it
was
time
he
contributed
something
to
the
speculation
.
He
said
:
"
If
he
does
n't
select
and
stalk
his
victim
,
and
obviously
he
did
n't
in
the
last
three
cases
,
he
'd
normally
have
to
expect
a
long
wait
.
That
suggests
he
's
routinely
out
after
dark
,
a
night
worker
,
mole-catcher
,
woodman
,
gamekeeper
,
that
kind
of
job
.
And
he
goes
prepared
;
on
the
watch
for
a
quick
kill
,
in
more
ways
than
one
.
"
Rickards
said
:
'That
's
how
I
see
it
.
Four
victims
so
far
and
three
fortuitous
,
but
he
's
probably
been
on
the
prowl
for
three
years
or
more
.
That
could
be
part
of
the
thrill
.
"

about

That
was
heard
by
the
three
people
who
came
quickly
on
the
scene
after
the
Easthaven
murder
.
One
just
heard
a
whistle
,
one
said
it
sounded
like
a
hymn
and
the
third
,
who
was
a
church
woman
,
claimed
she
could
identify
it
precisely
,
"
Now
the
Day
is
Over'
"
.
We
kept
quiet
about
that
.
It
could
be
useful
when
we
get
the
usual
clutch
of
nutters
claiming
they
're
the
Whistler
.
But
there
seems
no
doubt
that
he
does
whistle

He
remembered
it
from
childhood
,
a
lugubrious
,
undistinguished
tune
which
,
as
a
ten-year-old
,
he
could
pick
out
on
the
drawing-room
piano
.
Did
anyone
sing
that
hymn
now
,
he
wondered
?
It
had
been
a
favourite
choice
of
Miss
Barnett
on
those
long
dark
afternoons
m-
winter
before
the
Sunday
school
was
released
,
when
the
outside
light
was
fading
and
the
small
Adam
Dalgliesh
was
already
dreading
those
last
twenty
yards
of
his
walk
home
where
the
rectory
drive
curved
and
the
bushes
grew
thickest
.
Night
was
different
from
bright
day
,
smelt
different
,
sounded
different
;
ordinary
things
assumed
different
shapes
;
an
alien
and
more
sinister
power
ruled
the
night
.
Those
twenty
yards
of
crunching
gravel
where
the
lights
of
the
house
were
momentarily
screened
were
a
weekly
horror
.
Once
through
the
gate
to
the
drive
he
would
walk
fast
,
but
not
too
fast
since
the
power
that
ruled
the
night
could
smell
out
fear
as
dogs
smell
out
terror
.
His
mother
,
he
knew
,
would
never
have
expected
him
to
walk
those
yards
alone
had
she
known
that
he
suffered
such
atavistic
panic
,
but
she
had
n't
known
and
he
would
have
died
before
telling
her
.
And
his
father
?
His
father
would
have
expected
him
to
be
brave
,
would
have
told
him
that
God
was
God
of
the
darkness
as
He
was
of
the
light
.
There
were
after
all
a
dozen
appropriate
texts
he
could
have
quoted
.
"
Darkness
and
light
are
both
alike
to
Thee
.
"
But
they
were
not
alike
to
a
sensitive
ten-year-old
boy
.
It
was
on
those
lonely
walks
that
he
had
first
had
intimations
of
an
essentially
adult
truth
,
that
it
is
those
who
most
love
us
who
cause
us
the
most
pain
.

out

headland

No

was

Dalgliesh
would
have
expected

the
pitch
.
But
you
stayed
.
You
were
detached
about
it
all
,
were
n't
you
?
It
interested
you
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
It
's
always
interesting
when
men
you
thought
you
knew
behave
out
of
character
.
"
And
Rickards
had
fled
from
London
.
In
search
of
what
?
Dalgliesh
wondered
.
Some
romantic
dream
of
country
peace
,
an
England
which
had
vanished
,
a
gentler
method
of
policing
,
total
honesty
?
He
wondered
whether
he
had
found
it
.
It
was
ten
past
seven
and
the
saloon
bar
of
the
Duke
of
Clarence
pub
was
already
smoke-filled
,
the
noise
level
rising
and
the
crowd
at
the
bar
three
feet
deep
.
Christine
Baldwin
,
the
Whistler
's
fifth
victim
,
had
exactly
twenty
minutes
to
live
.
She
sat
on
the
banquette
against
the
wall
,
sipping
her
second
medium
sherry
of
the
evening
,
deliberately
making
it
last
,
knowing
that
Colin
was
impatient
to
order
the
next
round
.
Catching
Norman
's
eye
,
she
raised
her
left
wrist
and
nodded
significantly
at
her
watch
.
Already
,
it
was
ten
minutes
past
their
deadline
and
he
knew
it
.
Their
agreement
was
that
this
was
to
be
a
pre-supper
drink
with
Colin
and
Yvonne
,
the
limit
both
of
time
and
alcohol
consumption
clearly
understood
between
her
and
Norman
before
they
left
home
.
The
arrangement
was
typical
of
their
nine-month-old
marriage
,
sustained
less
by
compatible
interests
than
by
a
carefully
negotiated
series
of
concessions
.
Tonight
it
had
been
her
turn
to
give
way
,
but
agreeing
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
Clarence
with
Colin
and
Yvonne
did
n't
extend
to
any
pretence
that
she
actually
enjoyed
their
company
.
She
had
disliked
Colin
since
their
first
meeting
;
the
relationship
,
at
a
glance
,
had
been
fixed
in
the
stereotyped
antagonism
between
newly
acquired
fiancee
and
slightly
disreputable
old
schoolmate
and
drinking
partner
.
He
had
been
best
man
at
their
wedding
-
a
formidable
pre-nuptial
agreement
had
been
necessary
for
that
capitulation
-
and
had
carried
out
his
duties
with
a
mixture
of
incompetence
,
vulgarity
and
irreverence
which
,
as
she
occasionally
enjoyed
telling
Norman
,
had
spoilt
for
her
the
memory
of
her
big
day
.
It
was
typical
of
him
to
choose
this
pub
.
God
knew
,
it
was
vulgar
enough
.
But
at
least
she
could
be
certain
of
one
thing
:
it
was
n't
a
place
where
there
was
a
risk
of
meeting
anyone
from
the
power
station
,
at
least
not
anyone
who
mattered
.
She
disliked
everything
about
the
Clarence
,
the
rough
scrape
of
the
moquette
against
her
legs
,
the
synthetic
velvet
which
covered
the
walls
,
the
baskets
of
ivy
spiked
with
artificial
flowers
above
the
bar
,
the
gaudiness
of
the
carpet
.
Twenty
years
ago
,
it
had
been
a
cosy
Victorian
hostelry
,
seldom
visited
except
by
its
regulars
,
with
an
open
fire
in
winter
and
horse
brasses
polished
to
whiteness
hung
against
the
black
beams
.
The
lugubrious
publican
had
seen
it
as
his
job
to
repel
strangers
and
had
employed
to
that
end
an
impressive
armoury
of
taciturnity
,
malevolent
glances
,
warm
beer
and
poor
service
.
But
the
old
pub
had
burnt
down
in
the
1960s
and
been
replaced
by
a
more
profitable
and
thrusting
enterprise
.
Nothing
of
the
old
building
remained
and
the
long
extension
to
the
bar
,
dignified
by
the
name
Banqueting
Hall
,
provided
for
the
undiscriminating
a
venue
for
weddings
and
local
functions
and
on
other
nights
served
a
predictable
menu
of
prawns
or
soup
,
steak
or
chicken
,
and
fruit
salad
with
ice-cream
.
Well
,
at
least
she
had
put
her
foot
down
over
dinner
.
They
had
worked
out
their
monthly
budget
to
the
last
pound
,
and
if
Norman
thought
she
was
going
to
eat
this
overpriced
muck
with
a
perfectly
good
cold
supper
waiting
in
the
refrigerator
at
home
and
a
decent
programme
on
the
telly
he
could
forget
it
.
And
they
had
better
uses
for
their
money
than
to
sit
here
drinking
with
Colin
and
his
latest
tart
who
had
opened
her
legs
to
half
Norwich
,
if
rumour
were
to
be
believed
.
There
were
the
hire
purchase
repayments
on
the
sitting-room
furniture
and
the
car
,
not
to
mention
the
mortgage
.
She
tried
again
to
meet
Norman
's
eye
but
he
was
rather
desperately
keeping
his
attention
on
that
slut
Yvonne
.
And
that
was
n't
proving
difficult
.
Colin
leaned
over
to
her
,
his
bold
treacle-brown
eyes
half
mocking
,
half
inviting
,
Colin
Lomas
,
who
thought
every
woman
would
swoon
when
he
beckoned
.
"
Relax
,
darling
.
Your
old
man
's
enjoying
himself
.
It
's
your
round
,
Norm
.
"
Ignoring
Colin
she
spoke
to
Norman
:
"
Look
,
it
's
time
we
were
going
.
We
agreed
we
'd
leave

seven
.
"
"
Oh
,
come
on
,
Chrissie
,
give
the
lad
a
break
.
One
more
round
.
"
Without
meeting
her
eyes
,
Norman
said
:
"
What
'll
you
have
,
Yvonne
?
The
same
again
?
Medium
sherry
?
"
Colin
said
:
"
Let's
get
on
to
spirits
.
I
'll
have
a
Johnny
Walker
.
"
He
was
doing
it
on
purpose
.
She
knew
that
he
did
n't
even
like
whisky
.
She
said
:
"
Look
,
I
've
had
enough
of
this
bloody
place
.
The
noise
has
given
me
a
head
.
"
"
A
headache
?
Nine
months
married
and
she
's
started
the
headaches
.
No
point
in
hurrying
home
tonight
,
Norm
.
"
Yvonne
giggled
.
Christine
said
,
her
face
burning
,
"
You
were
always
vulgar
,
Colin
Lomas
,
but
now
you
're
not
even
funny

it
.
You

you
like

'm
going
home

Colin
leaned
back
and
smiled
.
"
You
heard
what
your
lady
wife
said
.
She
wants
the
car
keys
.
"
Without
a
word
,
shamefaced
,
Norman
took
them
out
of
his
pocket
and
slid
them
over
the
table
.
She
snatched
them
up
,
pushed
back
the
table
,
struggled
past
Yvonne
and
rushed
to
the
door
.
She
was
almost
crying
with
rage
.
It
took
her
a
minute
to
unlock
the
car
and
then
she
sat
shaking
behind
the
wheel
,
waiting
until
her
hands
were
steady
enough
to
switch
on
the
ignition
.
She
heard
her
mother
's
voice
on
the
day
when
she
had
announced
her
engagement
:
"
Well
,
you
're
thirty-two
and
if
he
's
what
you
want
I
suppose
you
know
your
own
mind
.
But
you
'll
never
make
anything
of
him
.
Weak
as
water
,
if
you
ask
me
.
"
But
she
had
thought
that
she
could
make
something
of
him
and
that
small
semi-detached
house
outside
Norwich
represented
nine
months
of
hard
work
and
achievement
.
Next
year
he
was
due
for
promotion
at
the
insurance
office
.
She
would
be
able
to
give
up
her
job
as
secretary
in
the
medical
physics
department
at
Larksoken
Power
Station
and
start
the
first
of
the
two
children
she
had
planned
.
She
would
be
thirty-four
by
then
.
Everyone
knew
that
you
should
n't
wait
too
long
.
She
had
only
passed
her
driving
test
after
her
marriage
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
driven
unaccompanied
by
night
.
She
drove
slowly
and
carefully
,
her
anxious
eyes
peering
ahead
,
glad
that
at
least
the
route
home
was
familiar
.
She
wondered
what
Norman
would
do
when
he
saw
that
the
car
had
gone
.
Almost
certainly
he
would
expect
to
find
her
sitting
there
,
fuming
but
ready
to
be
driven
home
.
Now
he
'd
have
to
rely
for
a
lift
on
Colin
who
would
n't
be
so
keen
on
coming
out
of
his
way
.
And
if
they
thought
that
she
was
going
to
invite
Colin
and
Yvonne
in
for
a
drink
when
they
arrived
they
would
get
a
shock
.
The
thought
of
Norman
's
discomfiture
at
finding
her
gone
cheered
her
a
little
and
she
pressed
her
foot
down
on
the
accelerator
,
anxious
to
distance
herself
from
the
three
of
them
,
to
reach
the
safety
of
home
.
But
suddenly
the
car
gave
a
stutter
and
the
engine
died
.
She
must
have
been
driving
more
erratically
than
she
thought
for
she
found
herself
half
skewed
across
the
road
.
It
was
a
bad
place
to
be
stranded
,
a
lonely
stretch
of
country
lane
with
a
thin
band
of
trees
on
either
side
and
it
was
deserted
.
And
then
she
remembered
.
Norman
had
mentioned
that
they
needed
to
fill
up
with
petrol
and
must
be
sure
to
call
at
the
all-night
garage
after
they
left
the
Clarence
.
It
was
ridiculous
to
have
let
the
tank
get
so
low
but
they
had
had
an
argument
only
three
days
earlier
on
whose
turn
it
was
to
call
at
the
garage
and
pay
for
the
petrol
.
All
her
anger
and
frustration
returned
.
For
a
moment
she
sat
there
,
beating
her
hands
impotently
on
the
wheel
,
desperately
turning
the
key
in
the
ignition
,
willing
the
engine
to
start
.
But
there
was
no
response
.
And
then
irritation
began
to
give
way
to
the
first
tricklings
of
fear
.
The
road
was
deserted
and
even
if
a
motorist
came
by
and
drew
up
,
could
she
be
certain
that
he
was
n't
a
kidnapper
,
a
rapist
,
even
the
Whistler
?
There
had
been
that
horrible
murder
on
the
A3
only
this
year
.
Nowadays
you
could
trust
no
one
.
And
she
could
hardly
leave
the
car
where
it
was
,
slewed
across
the
road
.
She
tried
to
recall
when
she
had
last
passed
a
house
,
an
AA
box
,
a
public
telephone
,
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
driving
through
deserted
countryside
for
at
least
ten
minutes
.
Even
if
she
left
the
dubious
sanctuary
of
the
car
she
had
no
clue
to
the
best
direction
in
which
to
seek
help
.
Suddenly
a
wave
of
total
panic
swept
across
her
like
nausea
and
she
had
to
resist
the
urge
to
dash
from
the
car
and
hide
herself
among
the
trees
.
But
what
good
would
that
do
?
He
might
be
lurking
even
there
.
An
then
,
miraculously
,
she
heard
footsteps
and
,
looking
round
,
saw
a
woman
approaching
.
She
was
dressed
in
trousers
and
a
trenchcoat
and
had
a
mane
of
fair
hair
beneath
a
tight-fitting
beret
.
At
her
side
on
a
leash
trotted
a
small
,
smooth-haired
dog
.
Immediately
all
her
anxiety
vanished
.
Here
was
someone
who
would
help
her
push
the
car
into
the
side
of
the
road
,
who
would
know
in
which
direction
lay
the
nearest
house
,
who
would
be
a
companion
on
her
walk
.
Without
even
troubling
to
slam
the
door
of
the
car
she
called
out
happily
and
ran
smiling
towards
the
horror
of
her
death
.
The
dinner
had
been
excellent
and
the
wine
,
a
Château
Potensac
'78
,
an
interesting
choice
with
the
main
course
.
Although
Dalgliesh
knew
of
Alice
Mair
's
reputation
as
a
cookery
writer
he
had
never
read
any
of
her
books
and
had
no
idea
to
what
culinary
school
,
if
any
,
she
belonged
.
He
had
hardly
feared
being
presented
with
the
usual
artistic
creation
swimming
in
a
pool
of
sauce
and
accompanied
by
one
or
two
undercooked
carrots
and
mange-tout
elegantly
arranged
on
a
side
plate
.
But
the
wild
ducks
carved
by
Alex
Mair
had
been
recognizably
ducks
,
the
piquant
sauce
,
new
to
him
,
enhanced
rather
than
dominated
the
taste
of
the
birds
,
and
the
small
mounds
of
creamed
turnip
and
parsnip
were
an
agreeable
addition
to
green
peas
.
Afterwards
they
had
eaten
orange
sorbet
followed
by
cheese
and
fruit
.
It
was
a
conventional
menu
but
one
intended
,
he
felt
,
to
please
the
guests
rather
than
to
demonstrate
the
ingenuity
of
the
cook
.
The
expected
fourth
guest
,
Miles
Lessingham
,
had
unaccountably
failed
to
arrive
,
but
Alice
Mair
had
n't
rearranged
her
table
and
the
empty
chair
and
unfilled
wineglass
were
uncomfortably
evocative
of
Banquo
's
ghost
.
Dalgliesh
was
seated
opposite
Hilary
Robarts
.
The
portrait
,
he
thought
,
must
have
been
even
more
powerful
than
he
realized
if
it
could
so
dominate
his
physical
reaction
to
the
living
woman
.
It
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
although
he
had
known
of
her
existence
as
he
had
of
all
the
handful
of
people
who
lived
,
as
the
Lydsett
villagers
said
,
"
t'
other
side
of
the
gate
"
.
And
it
was
a
little
strange
that
this
was
their
first
meeting
;
her
red
Golf
was
a
frequent
sight
on
the
headland
,
her
cottage
had
frequently
met
Iris
eyes
from
the
top
storey
of
the
mill
.
Now
,
physically
close
for
the
first
time
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
keep
his
eyes
off
her
,
living
flesh
and
remembered
image
seeming
to
fuse
into
a
presence
both
potent
and
disturbing
.
It
was
a
handsome
face
,
a
model
's
face
,
he
thought
,
with
its
high
cheekbones
,
long
,
slightly
concave
nose
,
wide
,
full
lips
and
dark
,
angry
eyes
deeply
set
under
the
strong
brows
.
Her
crimped
,
springing
hair
,
held
back
with
two
combs
,
fell
over
her
shoulders
.
He
could
imagine
her
posed
,
mouth
moistly
open
,
hips
jutting
and
staring
at
the
cameras
with
that
apparently
obligatory
look
of
arrogant
resentment
.
As
she
leaned
forward
to
twitch
another
grape
from
the
bunch
and
almost
toss
it
into
her
mouth
he
could
see
the
faint
freckles
which
smudged
the
dark
forehead
,
the
glisten
of
hairs
above
a
carved
upper
lip
.
On
the
other
side
of
their
host
sat
Meg
Dennison
,
delicately
but
unfussily
peeling
her
grapes
with
pink-tipped
fingers
.
Hilary
Robarts
's
sultry
handsomeness
emphasized
her
own
very
different
look
,
an
old-fashioned
,
carefully
tended
but
unselfconscious
prettiness
which
reminded
him
of
photographs
of
the
late
thirties
.
Their
clothes
emphasized
the
contrast
.
Hilary
wore
a
shirtwaister
dress
in
multicoloured
Indian
cotton
,
three
buttons
at
the
neck
undone
.
Meg
Dennison
was
in
a
long
black
skirt
and
a
blue
patterned
silk
blouse
with
a
bow
at
the
neck
.
But
it
was
their
hostess
who
was
the
most
elegant
.
The
long
shift
in
fine
dark
brown
wool
worn
with
a
heavy
necklace
of
silver
and
amber
hid
her
angularity
and
emphasized
the
strength
and
regularity
of
the
strong
features
.
Beside
her
Meg
Dennison
's
prettiness
was
diminished
almost
to
insipidity
and
Hilary
Robarts
's
strong-coloured
cotton
looked
tawdry
.
The
room
in
which
they
were
dining
must
,
he
thought
,
have
been
part
of
the
original
cottage
.
From
these
smoke-blackened
beams
Agnes
Poley
had
hung
her
sides
of
bacon
,
her
bundles
of
dried
herbs
.
In
a
pot
slung
over
that
huge
hearth
she
had
cooked
her
family
's
meals
and
,
perhaps
,
at
the
end
had
heard
in
its
roaring
flames
the
crackling
faggots
of
her
dreadful
martyrdom
.
Outside
the
long
window
had
passed
the
helmets
of
marching
men
.
But
only
in
the
name
of
the
cottage
was
there
a
memory
of
the
past
.
The
oval
dining
table
and
the
chairs
were
modern
as
were
the
Wedgwood
dinner
service
and
the
elegant
glasses
.
In
the
drawing
room
,
where
they
had
drunk
their
pre-dinner
sherry
,
Dalgliesh
had
a
sense
of
a
room
which
deliberately
rejected
the
past
,
containing
nothing
which
could
violate
the
owner
's
essential
privacy
;
no
family
history
in
photograph
or
portrait
,
no
shabby
heirlooms
given
room
out
of
nostalgia
,
sentimentality
or
family
piety
,
no
antiques
collected
over
the
years
.
Even
the
few
pictures
,
three
recognizably
by
John
Piper
,
were
modern
.
The
furniture
was
expensive
,
comfortable
,
well
heart
of
the
cottage
was
n't
there
.
It
was
in
that
large
,
warm-smelling
and
welcoming
kitchen
.
He
had
only
been
half
listening
to
the
conversation
but
now
he
forced
himself
to
be
a
more
accommodating
guest
.
The
talk
was
general
,
candlelit
faces
leaned
across
the
table
and
the
hands
which
peeled
the
fruit
or
fidgeted
with
the
glasses
were
as
individual
as
the
faces
.
Alice
Mair
's
strong
but
elegant
hands
with
their
short
nails
,
Hilary
Robarts
's
long
,
knobbled
fingers
,
the
delicacy
of
Meg
Dennison
's
pink-tipped
fingers
,
a
little
reddened
with
housework
.
Alex
Mair
was
saying
:
"
All
right
,
let's
take
a
modern
dilemma
.
We
know
that
we
can
use
human
tissue
from
aborted
foetuses
to
treat
Parkinson
"
s
disease
and
probably
Alzheimer
's
.
Presumably
you
'd
find
that
ethically
acceptable
if
the
abortion
were
natural
or
legal
but
not
if
it
were
induced
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
tissue
.
But
you
can
argue
that
a
woman
has
a
right
to
the
use
that
she
makes
of
her
own
body
.
If
she
's
particularly
fond
of
someone
who
has
Alzheimer
's
and
wants
to
help
him
by
producing
a
foetus
,
who
has
the
right
to
say
no
?
A
foetus
is
n't
a
child
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
:
"
I
notice
that
you
assume
the
sufferer
to
be
helped
is
a
man
.
I
suppose
he
'd
feel
entitled
to
use
a
woman
's
body
for
this
purpose
as
he
would
any
other
.
But
why
the
hell
should
he
?
I
ca
n't
imagine
that
a
woman
who
's
actually
had
an
abortion
wants
to
go
through
that
again
for
any
man
's
convenience
.
"
The
words
were
spoken
with
extreme
bitterness
.
There
was
a
pause
then
Mair
said
quietly
:
"
Alzheimer
's
is
rather
more
than
an
inconvenience
.
But
I
'm
not
advocating
it
.
In
any
case
,
under
present
law
,
it
would
be
illegal
.
"
"
Would
that
worry
you
?
"
He
looked
into
her
angry
eyes
.
"
Naturally
it
would
worry
me
.
Happily
it
is
n't
a
decision
that
I
shall
ever
be
required
to
make
.
But
we
're
not
talking
about
legality
,
we
're
talking
about
morality
.
"
His
sister
asked
:
"
Are
they
different
?
"
"
That
's
the
question
,
is
n't
it
?
Are
they
,
Adam
?
"
It
was
the
first
time
he
had
used
Dalgliesh
's
Christian
name
.
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
You
're
assuming
there
's
an
absolute
morality
independent
of
time
or
circumstance
.
"
"
Would
n't
you
make
that
assumption
?
"
"
Yes
,
I
think
I
would
,
but
I
'm
not
a
moral
philosopher
.
"
Mrs
Dennison
looked
up
from
her
plate
a
little
flushed
and
said
:
"
I
'm
always
suspicious
of
the
excuse
that
a
sin
is
justified
if
it
's
done
to
benefit
someone
we
love
.
We
may
think
so
,
but
it
's
usually
to
benefit
ourselves
.
I
might
dread
the
thought
of
having
to
look
after
an
Alzheimer
patient
.
When
we
advocate
euthanasia
is
it
to
stop
pain
or
to
prevent
our
own
distress
at
having
to
watch
it
?
To
conceive
a
child
deliberately
in
order
to
kill
it
to
make
use
of
its
tissue
,
the
idea
is
absolutely
repugnant
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
I
could
argue
that
what
you
are
killing
is
n't
a
child
and
that
repugnance
at
an
act
is
n't
evidence
of
its
immorality
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
But
is
n't
it
?
Does
n't
Mrs
Dennison
's
natural
repugnance
tell
us
something
about
the
morality
of
the
act
?
"
She
gave
him
a
brief
,
grateful
smile
and
went
on
:
"
And
is
n't
this
use
of
a
foetus
particularly
dangerous
?
It
could
lead
to
the
poor
of
the
world
conceiving
children
and
selling
the
foetuses
to
help
the
rich
.
Already
I
believe
there
's
a
black
market
in
human
organs
.
Do
you
think
a
multi-millionaire
who
needs
a
heart-lung
transplant
ever
goes
without
?
"
Alex
Mair
smiled
.
"
As
long
as
you
are
n't
arguing
that
we
should
deliberately
suppress
knowledge
or
reject
scientific
progress
just
because
the
discoveries
can
be
abused
.
If
there
are
abuses
,
legislate
against
them
.
"
Meg
protested
:
"
But
you
make
it
sound
so
easy
.
If
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
legislate
against
social
evils
Mr
Dalgliesh
for
one
would
be
out
of
work
.
"
"
It
is
n't
easy
but
it
has
to
be
attempted
.
That
's
what
being
human
means
,
surely
,
using
our
intelligence
to
make
choices
.
"
Alice
Mair
got
up
from
the
table
.
She
said
:
"
Well
,
it
's
time
to
make
a
choice
now
on
a
somewhat
different
level
.
Which
of
you
would
like
coffee
and
what
kind
?
There
's
a
table
and
chairs
in
the
courtyard
.
I
thought
we
could
switch
on
the
yard
lights
and
have
it
outside
.
"
They
moved
through
to
the
drawing
room
and
Alice
Mair
opened
the
french
windows
leading
to
the
patio
.
Immediately
the
sonorous
booming
of
the
sea
flowed
into
and
took
possession
of
the
room
like
a
vibrating
and
irresistible
force
.
But
once
they
had
stepped
out
into
the
cool
air
,
paradoxically
,
the
noise
seemed
muted
,
the
sea
no
more
than
a
distant
roar
.
The
patio
was
bounded
on
the
road
side
by
a
high
flint
wall
which
,
to
the
south
and
east
,
curved
to
little
more
than
four
feet
to
give
an
unimpeded
view
across
the
headland
to
the
sea
.
The
coffee
tray
was
carried
out
by
Alex
Mair
within
minutes
and
,
cups
in
hand
,
the
little
party
wandered
aimlessly
among
the
terracotta
pots
like
strangers
reluctant
to
be
introduced
or
like
actors
on
a
stage
set
,
self-absorbed
,
pondering
their
lines
,
waiting
for
the
rehearsal
to
begin
.
They
were
without
coats
and
the
warmth
of
the
night
had
proved
illusory
.
They
had
turned
as
if
by
common
consent
to
go
back
into
the
cottage
when
the
lights
of
a
car
,
driven
fast
,
came
over
the
southern
rise
of
the
road
.
As
it
approached
its
speed
slackened
.
Mair
said
:
"
Lessingham
's
Porsche
.
"
No
one
spoke
.
They
watched
silently
as
the
car
was
driven
at
speed
off
the
road
to
brake
violently
on
the
turf
of
the
headland
.
as
if
conforming
to
some
prearranged
ceremony
they
grouped
themselves
into
a
semicircle
with
Alex
Mair
a
little
to
the
front
,
like
a
formal
welcoming
party
but
one
bracing
itself
for
trouble
rather
than
expecting
pleasure
from
the
approaching
guest
.
Dalgliesh
was
aware
of
the
heightening
tension
:
small
individual
tremors
of
anxiety
which
shivered
on
the
still
,
sea-scented
air
,
unified
and
focused
on
the
car
door
and
on
the
tall
figure
which
unwound
from
the
driver
's
seat
,
leapt
easily
over
the
low
stone
wall
and
walked
deliberately
across
the
courtyard
towards
them
.
Lessingham
ignored
Mair
and
moved
straight
to
Alice
.
He
took
her
hand
and
gently
kissed
it
,
a
theatrical
gesture
which
Dalgliesh
felt
had
taken
her
by
surprise
and
which
the
others
had
watched
with
an
unnaturally
critical
attention
.
Lessingham
said
gently
:
"
My
apologies
,
Alice
.
Too
late
for
dinner
,
I
know

"
"
Where
have
you
been
?
We
waited
dinner
for
forty
minutes
.
"
It
was
Hilary
Robarts
who
asked
the
obvious
question
,
sounding
as
accusatory
as
a
peevish
wife
.
Lessingham
kept
his
eye
on
Alice
.
He
said
:
"
I
've
been
considering
how
best
to
answer
that
question
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
.
There
are
a
number
of
interesting
and
dramatic
possibilities
.
I
could
say
that
I
've
been
helping
the
police
with
their
inquiries
.
Or
that
I
've
been
involved
in
a
murder
.
Or
that
there
was
a
little
unpleasantness
on
the
road
.
Actually
it
was
all
three
.
The
Whistler
has
killed
again
.
I
found
the
body
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
sharply
:
"
How
do
you
mean
,
"
found'
"
?
Where
?
"
Again
Lessingham
ignored
her
.
He
said
to
Alice
Mair
:
"
Could
I
have
that
drink
?
Then
I
'll
give
you
all
the
gory
details
.
After
unsettling
your
seating
plan
and
delaying
dinner
for
forty
minutes
that
's
the
least
I
owe
you
.
"
As
they
moved
back
into
the
drawing
room
Alex
Mair
introduced
Dalgliesh
.
Lessingham
gave
him
one
sharp
glance
.
They
shook
hands
.
The
palm
which
momentarily
touched
his
was
moist
and
very
cold
.
Alex
Mair
said
easily
:
"
Why
did
n't
you
ring
?
We
would
have
kept
some
food
for
you
.
"
The
question
,
conventionally
domestic
,
sounded
irrelevant
,
but
Lessingham
answered
it
.
"
Do
you
know
,
I
actually
forgot
.
Not
all
the
time
,
of
course
,
but
it
honestly
did
n't
cross
my
mind
until
the
police
had
finished
questioning
me
and
then
the
moment
did
n't
seem
opportune
.
They
were
perfectly
civil
but
I
sensed
that
my
private
engagements
had
a
pretty
low
priority
.
Incidentally
,
you
get
absolutely
no
credit
from
the
police
for
finding
a
body
for
them
.
Their
attitude
is
rather
,
"
'Thank
you
very
much
,
sir
,
very
nasty
,
I
'm
sure
.
Sorry
you
've
been
troubled
.
But
we
'll
take
over
now
.
Just
go
home
and
try
to
forget
all
about
it
.
'
"
I
have
a
feeling
that
that
is
n't
going
to
be
so
easy
.
"
Back
in
the
drawing
room
,
Alex
Mair
threw
a
couple
of
thin
logs
on
to
the
glowing
embers
and
went
to
get
the
drinks
.
Lessingham
had
refused
whisky
but
had
asked
for
wine
.
"
But
do
n't
waste
your
best
claret
on
me
,
Alex
.
This
is
purely
medicinal
.
"
Almost
imperceptibly
they
edged
their
chairs
closer
.
Lessingham
began
his
story
deliberately
,
pausing
at
times
to
take
gulps
of
the
wine
.
It
seemed
to
Dalgliesh
that
he
was
subtly
altered
since
his
arrival
,
had
become
charged
with
a
power
both
mysterious
and
oddly
familiar
.
He
thought
:
He
has
acquired
the
mystique
of
the
story-teller
and
,
glancing
at
the
ring
of
fire-lit
and
intent
faces
,
he
was
suddenly
reminded
of
his
first
village
school
,
of
the
children
clustered
round
Miss
Douglas
at
three
o'clock
on
a
Friday
afternoon
for
the
half
hour
of
story-time
,
and
felt
a
pang
of
pain
and
regret
for
those
lost
days
of
innocence
and
love
.
He
was
surprised
that
the
memory
should
have
come
back
so
keenly
and
at
such
a
moment
.
But
this
was
to
be
a
very
different
story
and
one
unsuited
to
the
ears
of
children
.
Lessingham
said
:
"
I
had
an
appointment
with
my
dentist
in
Norwich
at
five
o'clock
and
then
briefly
visited
a
friend
in
the
Close
.
So
I
drove
here
from
Norwich
,
not
from
my
cottage
.
I
'd
just
turned
right
off
the
B1
150
at
Fairstead
when
I
nearly
crashed
into
the
back
of
this
unlit
car
skewed
across
the
road
.
I
thought
it
was
a
damn
silly
place
to
park
if
someone
wanted
to
take
a
leak
in
the
bushes
.
Then
it
crossed
my
mind
that
there
could
have
been
an
accident
.
And
the
right-hand
door
was
open
,
that
seemed
a
bit
odd
.
So
I
drew
into
the
side
and
went
to
take
a
look
.
There
was
no
one
about
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
I
walked
into
the
trees
.
A
kind
of
instinct
I
suppose
.
It
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
and
I
wondered
whether
to
call
out
.
Then
I
felt
a
fool
and
decided
to
leave
it
and
mind
my
own
business
.
And
it
was
then
that
I
almost
tripped
over
her
.
"
He
took
another
gulp
of
the
wine
.
"
I
still
could
n't
see
anything
,
of
course
,
but
I
knelt
down
and
groped
about
with
my
hands
.
And
it
was
then
that
I
touched
flesh
.
I
think
I
touched
her
thigh
,
I
ca
n't
be
sure
.
But
flesh
,
even
dead
flesh
,
is
unmistakable
.
So
I
went
back
to
the
car
and
got
my
torch
.
I
shone
it
on
her
feet
and
then
slowly
up
her
body
to
her
face
.
And
then
,
of
course
,
I
saw
.
I
knew
it
was
the
Whistler
.
"
Meg
Dennison
asked
gently
:
"
Was
it
very
terrible
?
"
He
must
have
heard
in
her
voice
what
she
obviously
felt
,
not
prurience
but
sympathy
,
an
understanding
that
he
needed
to
talk
.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
if
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
then
paused
,
giving
the
question
serious
thought
.
"
More
shocking
than
terrible
.
Looking
back
my
emotions
were
complicated
,
a
mixture
of
horror
,
disbelief
and
,
well
,
shame
.
I
felt
like
a
voyeur
.
The
dead
,
after
all
,
are
at
such
a
disadvantage
.
She
looked
grotesque
,
a
little
ridiculous
,
with
thin
clumps
of
hair
sticking
out
of
her
mouth
as
if
she
was
munching
.
Horrible
,
of
course
,
but
silly
at
the
same
time
.
I
had
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
giggle
.
I
know
it
was
only
a
reaction
to
shock
but
it
was
hardly
admirable
.
And
the
whole
scene
was
so
,
well
,
banal
.
If
you
had
asked
me
to
describe
one
of
the
Whistler
's
victims
that
's
exactly
how
I
should
have
seen
her
.
You
expect
reality
to
be
different
from
imaginings
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
Perhaps
because
the
imaginings
are
usually
worse
.
"
Meg
Dennison
said
gently
:
"
You
must
have
been
terrified
.
I
know
I
should
have
been
.
Alone
and
in
darkness
with
such
horror
.
"
He
shifted
his
body
towards
her
and
spoke
as
if
it
were
important
that
she
,
of
all
those
present
,
should
understand
.
"
No
,
not
terrified
,
that
was
the
surprising
part
.
I
was
frightened
,
of
course
,
but
only
for
a
second
or
two
.
After
all
,
I
did
n't
imagine
he
'd
wait
around
.
He
'd
had
his
kicks
.
He
is
n't
interested
in
men
anyway
.
I
found
myself
thinking
the
ordinary
,
commonplace
thoughts
.
I
must
n't
touch
anything
.
I
must
n't
destroy
the
evidence
.
I
've
got
to
get
the
police
.
Then
,
walking
back
to
the
car
,
I
started
rehearsing
what
I
'd
say
to
them
,
almost
as
if
I
were
concocting
my
story
.
I
tried
to
explain
why
it
was
that
I
went
into
the
bushes
,
tried
to
make
it
sound
reasonable
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
What
was
there
to
justify
?
You
did
what
you
did
.
It
sounds
reasonable
enough
to
me
.
The
car
was
a
danger
slewed
across
the
road
.
It
would
have
been
irresponsible
just
to
drive
on
.
"
"
It
seemed
to
need
a
lot
of
explaining
,
then
and
later
.
Perhaps
because
all
the
subsequent
police
sentences
began
with
"
why'
"
.
You
get
morbidly
sensitive
to
your
own
motives
.
It
's
almost
as
if
you
have
to
convince
yourself
that
you
did
n't
do
it
.
"
Hilary
Robarts
said
impatiently
:
"
But
the
body
,
when
you
first
went
back
for
the
torch
and
saw
her
,
you
were
certain
she
was
dead
?
"
"
Oh
yes
,
I
knew
she
was
dead
.
"
"
How
could
you
have
known
?
It
could
have
been
very
recent
.
Why
did
n't
you
at
least
try
to
resuscitate
her
,
give
her
the
kiss
of
life
?
It
would
have
been
worth
overcoming
your
natural
repugnance
.
"
Dalgliesh
heard
Meg
Dennison
make
a
small
sound
between
a
gasp
and
a
groan
.
Lessingham
looked
at
Hilary
and
said
coolly
:
"
It
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
the
slightest
point
in
it
.
I
knew
she
was
dead
,
let's
leave
it
at
that
.
But
do
n't
worry
,
if
I
ever
rind
you
in
extremis
I
'll
endeavour
to
overcome
my
natural
repugnance
.
"
Hilary
relaxed
and
gave
a
little
self-satisfied
smile
,
as
if
gratified
to
have
stung
him
into
a
cheap
retort
.
Her
voice
was
more
natural
as
she
said
:
"
I
'm
surprised
you
were
n't
treated
as
a
suspect
.
After
all
,
you
were
the
first
on
the
scene
,
and
this
is
the
second
time
you
've
been
,
well
almost
,
in
at
the
death
.
It
's
becoming
a
habit
.
"
The
last
words
were
spoken
almost
under
her
breath
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
Lessingham
's
face
.
He
met
her
glance
and
said
,
with
equal
quietness
:
"
But
there
's
a
difference
,
is
n't
there
?
I
had
to
watch
Toby
die
,
remember
?
And
this
time
no
one
will
even
try
to
pretend
that
it
is
n't
murder
.
"
The
fire
gave
a
sudden
crackle
and
the
top
log
rolled
over
and
fell
into
the
hearth
.
Mair
,
his
face
flushed
,
kicked
it
viciously
back
.
Hilary
Robarts
,
perfectly
calm
,
turned
to
Dalgliesh
.
"
But
I
'm
right

n't
I

Do
n't
the
police
usually
suspect
the
person
who
finds
the
body

"
He
said
quietly
:
"
Not
necessarily
.
"
Lessingham
had
placed
the
bottle
of
claret
on
the
hearth
.
Now
he
leaned
down
and
carefully
refilled
his
glass
.
He
said
:
"
They
might
have
suspected
me
,
I
suppose
,
but
for
a
number
of
lucky
circumstances

I
was
obviously
out
on
my
lawful
occasions
.
I
have
an
alibi
for
at
least
two
of
the
previous
killings
.
From
their
point
of
view
I
was
depressingly
free
of
blood
.
I
suppose
they
could
see
I
was
in
a
mild
state
of
shock
.
And
there
was
no
sign
of
the
ligature
which
strangled
her
,
nor
of
the
knife
.
"
Hilary
said
sharply
:
"
What
knife
?
The
Whistler
's
a
strangler

Everyone
knows

's
how
he
kills

"
"
Oh
,
I
did
n't
mention
that
,
did
I
?
She
was
strangled
all
right
,
or
I
suppose
she
was
.
I
did
n't
keep
the
torchlight
on
her
face
longer
than
was
necessary
.
But
he
marks
his
victims
,
apart
from
stuffing
their
mouths
with
hair
.
Pubic
hair
,
incidentally
.
I
saw
that
all
right
.
There
was
the
letter
L
cut
into
her
forehead
.
Quite
unmistakable
.
A
detective-constable
who
was
talking
to
me
later
told
me
that
it
's
one
of
the
Whistler
's
trademarks
.
He
thought
that
the
L
could
stand
for
Larksoken
and
that
the
Whistler
might
be
making
some
kind
of
statement
about
nuclear
power
,
a
protest
perhaps
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
sharply
:
"
That
's
nonsense

Then
added
more
calmly
:
"

nothing

foreheads

"
The

it

detail

can
use
to
sort
out
the
false
confessions
.
There
have
been
half
a
dozen
of
those
already
apparently
.
There
's
been
nothing
in
the
media
about
the
hair
either
,
but
that
piece
of
unpleasantness
seems
to
be
generally
known
.
After
all
,
I
'm
not
the
only
one
to
have
found
a
body

People

Hilary
Robarts
said
:
"
Nothing
has
been
written
or
said
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
about
it
being
pubic
hair
.
"
"
No
,
the
police
are
keeping
that
quiet
too
,
and
it
's
hardly
the
sort
of
detail
you
print
in
a
family
newspaper
.
Not
that
it
's
so
very
surprising
.
He
is
n't
a
rapist
but
there
was
bound
to
be
some
sexual
element
.
"
It
was
one
of
the
details
which
Rickards
had
told
Dalgliesh
the
previous
evening
but
one
,
he
felt
,
which
Lessingham
could
well
have
kept
to
himself
,
particularly
at
a
mixed
dinner
party
.
He
was
a
little
surprised
at
his
sudden
sensitivity
.
perhaps
it
was
his
glance
at
Meg
Dennison
's
ravaged
face
.
And
then
his
ears
caught
a
faint
sound
.
He
looked
across
to
the
open
door
of
the
dining
room
and
glimpsed
the
slim
figure
of
Theresa
Blaney
standing
in
the
shadows
.
He
wondered
how
much
of
Lessingham
's
account
she
had
heard
.
However
little
,
it
would
have
been
too
much
.
He
said
,
hardly
aware
of
the
severity
in
his
voice
:
'Did
n't
Chief
Inspector
Rickards
ask
you
to
keep
this
information
confidential
?
"
There
was
an
embarrassed
silence
.
He
thought
,
They
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
that
I
'm
a
policeman
.
Lessingham
turned
to
him
.
"
I
intend
to
keep
it
confidential
.
Rickards
did
n't
want
it
to
become
public
knowledge
and
it
wo
n't
.
No
one
here
will
pass
it
on
.
"
But
that
single
question
,
reminding
them
of
who
he
was
and
what
he
represented
,
chilled
the
room
and
changed
their
mood
from
fascinated
and
horrified
interest
to
a
slightly
embarrassed
unease
.
And
when
,
a
minute
later
,
he
got
up
to
say
his
goodbyes
and
thank
his
hostess
,
there
was
an
almost
visible
sense
of
relief
.
He
knew
that
the
embarrassment
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fear
that
he
would
question
,
criticize
,
move
like
a
spy
among
them
.
It
was
n't
his
case
and
they
were
n't
suspects
,
and
they
must
have
known
that
he
was
no
cheerful
extrovert
,
flattered
to
be
the
centre
of
attraction
while
they
bombarded
him
with
questions
about
Chief
Inspector
Rickards
's
likely
methods
,
the
chance
of
catching
the
Whistler
,
his
theories
about
psychopathic
killers
,
his
own
experience
of
serial
murder
.
But
merely
by
being
there
he
increased
their
awakening
fear
and
repugnance
at
this
latest
horror
.
On
each
of
their
minds
was
imprinted
the
mental
image
of
that
violated
face
,
the
half-open
mouth
stuffed
with
hair
,
those
staring
,
sightless
eyes
,
and
his
presence
intensified
the
picture
,
brought
it
into
sharper
focus
.
Horror
and
death
were
his
trade
and
,
like
an
undertaker
,
he
carried
with
him
the
contagion
of
his
craft
.
He
was
at
the
front
door
when
,
on
impulse
,
he
turned
back
and
said
to
Meg
Dennison
:
"
I
think
you
mentioned
that
you
walked
from
the
Old
Rectory
,
Mrs
Dennison
.
Could
I
walk
home
with
you
,
that
is
if
it
's
not
too
early
for
you
?
"
Alex
Mair
was
beginning
to
say
that
he
,
of
course
,
would
drive
her
but
Meg
extricated
herself
clumsily
from
her
chair
and
said
,
a
little
too
eagerly
:
"
I
'd
be
grateful
if
you
would
.
I
would
like
the
walk
and
it
would
save
Alex
getting
out
the
car
.
"
Alice
Mair
said
:
"
And
it
's
time
Theresa
was
on
her
way
.
We
should
have
driven
her
home
an
hour
ago
.
I
'll
give
her
father
a
ring
.
Where
is
she
,
by
the
way
?
"
Meg
said
:
"
I
think
she
was
next
door
clearing
the
table
a
minute
ago
.
"
Well
,
I
'll
find
her
and
Alex
can
drive
her
home
.
"
The
party
was
breaking
up
.
Hilary
Robarts
had
been
slumped
back
in
her
chair
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
Lessingham
.
Now
she
got
to
her
feet
and
said
:
"
I
'll
get
back
to
my
cottage
.
There
's
no
need
for
anyone
to
come
with
me
.
As
Miles
has
said
,
the
Whistler
's
had
his
kicks
for
tonight
.
"
Alex
Mair
said
:
"
I
'd
rather
you
waited
.
I
'll
walk
with
you
once
I
've
taken
Theresa
home
.
"
She
shrugged
and
,
without
looking
at
him
,
said
:
"
All
right
,
if
you
insist
.
I
'll
wait
.
"
She
moved
over
to
the
window
,
staring
out
into
the
darkness
.
Only
Lessingham
stayed
in
his
chair
,
reaching
again
to
fill
his
glass
.
Dalgliesh
saw
that
Alex
Mair
had
silently
placed
another
opened
bottle
in
the
hearth
.
He
wondered
whether
Alice
Mair
would
invite
Lessingham
to
stay
the
night
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
or
whether
he
would
be
driven
home
later
by
her
or
her
brother
.
He
would
certainly
be
in
no
state
to
drive
himself
.
Dalgliesh
was
helping
Meg
Dennison
into
her
jacket
when
the
telephone
rang
,
sounding
unnaturally
strident
in
the
quiet
room
.
He
felt
her
sudden
shock
of
fear
and
for
a
moment
,
almost
involuntarily
,
his
hands
strengthened
on
her
shoulders
.
They
heard
Alex
Mair
's
voice
.
"
Yes
,
we
've
heard
.
Miles
Lessingham
is
here
and
gave
us
the
details
.
Yes
,
I
see
.
Yes
.
Thank
you
for
letting
me
know
.
"
Then
there
was
a
longer
silence
,
then
Mair
's
voice
again
.
"
Completely
fortuitous
,
I
should
say
,
would
n't
you
?
After
all
,
we
have
a
staff
of
five
hundred
and
thirty
.
But
naturally
everyone
at
Larksoken
will
find
the
news
deeply
shocking
,
the
women
particularly
.
Yes
,
I
shall
be
in
my
office
tomorrow
if
there
's
any
help
I
can
give

Her
family
have
been
told
,
I
suppose
?
Yes
,
I
see
.
Good
night
,
Chief
Inspector
.
"
He
put
down
the
receiver
and
said
:
"
That
was
Chief
Inspector
Rickards
.
They
've
identified
the
victim
.
Christine
Baldwin
.
She
is
-
she
was
-
a
typist
at
the
station
.
You
did
n't
recognize
her
then
,
Miles
?
"
Lessingham
took
his
time
refilling
his
glass
.
He
said
:
The
police
did
n't
tell
me
who
she
was
.
Even
if
they
had
,
I
would
n't
have
remembered
the
name
.
And
no
,
Alex
,
I
did
n't
recognize
her
.
I
suppose
I
must
have
seen
Christine
Baldwin
at
Larksoken
,
probably
in
the
canteen
.
But
what
I
saw
earlier
tonight
was
n't
Christine
Baldwin
.
And
I
can
assure
you
that
I
did
n't
shine
the
torch
on
her
longer
than
I
needed
to
satisfy
myself
that
she
was
beyond
any
help
that
I
could
give
.
"
Without
looking
round
from
the
window
Hilary
Robarts
said
:
"
Christine
Baldwin
.
Aged
thirty-three
.
Actually
,
she
's
only
been
with
us
for
eleven
months
.
Married
last
year
.
Just
transferred
to
the
medical
physics
department
.
I
can
give
you
her
typing
and
shorthand
speeds
if
you
're
interested
.
"
Then
she
turned
round
and
looked
Alex
Mair
in
the
face
.
"
It
looks
as
if
the
Whistler
's
getting
closer
,
does
n't
it
,
in
more
ways
than
one
.
"
The
final
goodbyes
were
said
and
they
stepped
out
from
the
smell
of
wood
smoke
,
food
and
wine
from
a
room
which
Dalgliesh
was
beginning
to
find
uncomfortably
warm
into
the
fresh
,
sea-scented
air
.
It
took
a
few
minutes
before
his
eyes
had
adjusted
to
semi-darkness
and
the
great
sweep
of
the
headland
became
visible
,
its
shapes
and
forms
mysteriously
altered
under
the
high
stars
.
To
the
north
the
power
station
was
a
glittering
galaxy
of
white
lights
,
its
stark
geometric
bulk
subsumed
in
the
blue-black
of
the
sky
.
They
stood
for
a
moment
regarding
it
,
then
Meg
Dennison
said
:
"
When
I
first
came
here
from
London
it
almost
frightened
me
,
the
sheer
size
of
it
,
the
way
it
dominates
the
headland
.
But
I
'm
getting
used
to
it
.
It
's
still
disturbing
but
it
does
have
a
certain
grandeur
.
Alex
tries
to
demystify
it
,
says
its
function
is
just
to
produce
electricity
for
the
National
Grid
efficiently
and
cleanly
,
that
the
main
difference
between
this
and
any
other
power
station
is
that
you
do
n't
have
beside
it
a
huge
pyramid
of
polluting
coal
dust
.
But
atomic
power
to
my
generation
always
means
that
mushroom
cloud
.
And
now
it
means
Chernobyl
.
But
if
it
were
an
ancient
castle
standing
there
against
the
skyline
,
if
what
we
looked
out
at
tomorrow
morning
was
a
row
of
turrets
,
we
'd
probably
be
saying
how
magnificent
it
is
.
"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
If
it
had
a
row
of
turrets
it
would
be
a
rather
different
shape
.
But
I
know
what
you
mean
.
I
should
prefer
the
headland
without
it
but
it
's
beginning
to
look
as
if
it
had
a
right
to
be
there
.
"
They
turned
simultaneously
from
contemplating
the
glittering
lights
and
looked
south
to
the
decaying
symbol
of
a
very
different
power
.
Before
them
,
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
,
crumbling
against
the
skyline
like
a
child
's
sandcastle
rendered
amorphous
by
the
advancing
tide
,
was
the
ruined
Benedictine
abbey
.
He
could
just
make
out
the
great
empty
arch
of
the
east
window
and
beyond
it
the
shimmer
of
the
North
Sea
while
above
,
seeming
to
move
through
and
over
it
like
a
censer
,
swung
the
smudged
yellow
disc
of
the
moon
.
Almost
without
conscious
will
they
took
their
first
steps
from
the
track
on
to
the
rough
headland
towards
it
.
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Shall
we
?
Can
you
spare
the
time
?
And
what
about
your
shoes
?
"
"
Reasonably
sensible
.
Yes
,
I
'd
like
to
,
it
looks
so
wonderful
at
night
.
And
I
do
n't
really
need
to
hurry
.
The
Copleys
wo
n't
have
waited
up
for
me
.
Tomorrow
,
when
I
have
to
tell
them
how
close
the
Whistler
is
getting
,
I
may
not
like
to
leave
them
alone
after
dark
.
This
may
be
my
last
free
night
for
some
time
.
"
"
I
do
n't
think
they
'd
be
in
any
real
danger
as
long
as
you
lock
up
securely
.
So
far
all
his
victims
have
been
young
women
and
he
kills
out
of
doors
.
"
I
tell
myself
that
.
And
I
do
n't
think
they
'd
be
seriously
frightened
.
Sometimes
the
very
old
seem
to
have
moved
beyond
that
kind
of
fear
.
The
trivial
upsets
of
daily
living
assume
importance
but
the
big
tragedies
they
take
in
their
stride
.
But
their
daughter
is
constantly
ringing
up
to
suggest
they
go
to
her
in
Wiltshire
until
he
's
caught
.
They
do
n't
want
to
but
she
's
a
strong-minded
woman
and
very
insistent
,
and
if
she
telephones
after
dusk
and
I
'm
not
there
it
will
increase
the
pressure
on
them
.
"
She
paused
and
then
said
:
"
It
was
a
horrible
end

an
interesting

rather
strange
dinner
party

I
wish
Mr
Lessingham
had
kept
the
details
to
himself

but
I
suppose
it
helped
him
to
talk
about
it
,
especially

another

remember
a
paragraph
in
one

the
papers

"
"
It
was
an
appalling
tragedy
.
Toby
Gledhill
was
one
of
Alex
's
most
brilliant
young
scientists
.
He
broke
his
neck
by
throwing
himself
down
on
top
of
the
reactor
.
"
"
So
there
was
no
mystery
about
it
?
"
"
Oh
no
,
absolutely
none
,
except
why
he
did
it
.
Mr
Lessingham
saw
it
happen
.
I
'm
surprised
you
remember
it
.
There
was
very
little
about
it
in
the
national
press
.
Alex
tried
to
minimize
the
publicity
to
protect
his
parents
.
"
And
to
protect
the
power
station
,
thought
Dalgliesh
.
He
wondered
why
Lessingham
had
described
Gledhill
's
death
as
murder
but
he
did
n't
question
his
companion
further
.
The
allegation
had
been
spoken
so
quietly
that
he
doubted
whether
she
had
in
fact
heard
it
.
Instead
he
asked
:
"
Are
you
happy
living
on
the
headland
?
"
The
question
did
not
appear
to
surprise
her
but
it
did
surprise
him
,
as
did
the
very
fact
that
they
were
walking
so
companionably
together
.
She
was
curiously
restful
to
be
with
.
He
liked
her
quiet
gentleness
with
its
suggestion
of
underlying
strength
.
Her
voice
was
pleasant
and
voices
were
important
to
him
.
But
six
months
ago
none
of
this
would
have
been
enough
to
make
him
invite
her
company
for
longer
than
was
politely
necessary
.
He
would
have
escorted
her
back
to
the
Old
Rectory
and
then
,
a
minor
social
obligation
performed
,
turned
with
relief
to
walk
alone
to
the
abbey
,
drawing
his
solitude
around
him
like
a
cloak
.
That
solitude
was
still
essential
to
him
.
He
could
n't
tolerate
twenty-four
hours
in
which
the
greater
part
was
n't
spent
entirely
alone
.
But
some
change
in
himself
,
the
inexorable
years
,
success
,
the
return
of
his
poetry
,
perhaps
the
tentative
beginning
of
love
,
seemed
to
be
making
him
sociable
.
He
was
n't
sure
whether
this
was
something
to
be
welcomed
or
resisted
.
He
was
aware
that
she
was
giving
his
question
careful
thought
.
"
Yes
,
I
think
that
I
am
.
Sometimes
very
happy
.
I
came
here
to
escape
from
the
problems
of
my
life
in
London
and
,
without
really
meaning
to
,
I
came
as
far
east
as
I
could
get
.
"
"
And
found
yourself
confronting
two
different
forms
of
menace
,
the
power
station
and
the
Whistler
.
"
"
Both
frightening
because
both
mysterious
,
both
rooted
in
a
horror
of
the
unknown
.
But
the
menace
is
n't
personal
,
is
n't
directed
specifically
against
me
.
But
I
did
run
away
and
,
I
suppose
,
all
refugees
carry
with
them
a
small
burden
of
guilt
.
And
I
miss
the
children
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
stayed
and
fought
on
.
But
it
was
becoming
a
very
public
war
.
I
'm
not
suited
to
the
role
of
popular
heroine
of
the
more
reactionary
press
.
All
I
wanted
was
to
be
left
alone
to
get
on
with
the
job
I
'd
been
trained
for
and
loved
.
But
every
book
I
used
,
every
word
I
spoke
was
scrutinized
.
You
ca
n't
teach
in
an
atmosphere
of
rancorous
suspicion
.
In
the
end
I
found
I
could
n't
even
live
in
it
.

was

out

preserve
one

sanity

They
were
approaching
the
abbey
now
and
the
grass
of
the
headland
was
becoming
more
hillocky
.
She
stumbled
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
steady
her
.
She
said
:
"
In
the
end
it
came
down
to
just
two
letters

should
be
called
the
chalkboard
.
Black
or
chalk

I
did
n't

still
do
n't

The
word
black
in
itself
ca
n't
be
offensive
.
I
'd
called
it
that
all
my
life
so
why
should
they
try
to
force
me
to
change
the
way
I
speak
my
own
language
?
And
yet
,
at
this
moment
,
on
this
headland
,
under
this
sky
,
this
immensity
,
it
all
seems
so
petty

all
I
did
was
to
elevate
trivia

a
principle

up
the

told

She
went
to
the
stake
,
apparently
,
for
an
obstinate
adherence
to
her
own
uncompromising
view
of
the
universe

her
earthbound

The
Lady

They
were
offering
free
accommodation
and
food
to
someone
who
would
do
what
they
described
as
a
little
gentle
housework

's
a
euphemism

dusting

a
great

female
friendship

"
Dalgliesh
said
:
"
Agnes
Poley
would
have
understood
that
atmosphere
too
.
It
was
the
one
she
breathed

"
For
a
minute
they
walked
in
silence
hearing
the
rustle
of
the
long
grasses
over
their
shoes
.
Dalgliesh
wondered
why
it
was
that
,
when
walking
towards
the
sea
,
there
came
a
moment
when
its
roar
suddenly
increased
as
if
a
menace
,
quiescent
and
benign
,
had
suddenly
realized
and
gathered
up
its
power
.
Looking
up
at
the
sky
,
at
the
myriad
pinpricks
of
light
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
feel
the
turning
earth
beneath
his
feet
and
that
time
had
mysteriously
come
to
a
stop
,
fusing
into
one
moment
the
past
,
the
present
and
the
future
;
the
ruined
abbey
,
the
obstinately
enduring
artefacts
of
the
last
war
,
the
crumbling
cliff
defences
,
the
windmill
and
the
power
station
.
And
he
wondered
whether
it
was
in
such
a
disorientating
limbo
of
time
,
listening
to
the
ever-restless
sea
,
that
the
previous
owners
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
had
chosen
their
text
.
Suddenly
his
companion
stopped
and
said
:
"
There
"
s
a
light
in
the
ruins
.
Two
small
flashes
,
like
a
torch
.
"
They
stood
still
and
watched
in
silence
.
Nothing
appeared
.
She
said
,
almost
apologetically
:
"
I
'm
sure
I
saw
it
.
And
there
was
a
shadow
,
something
or
somebody
moving
against
the
eastern
window
.
You
did
n't
see
it
?
"
"
I
was
looking
at
the
sky
.
"
She
said
,
almost
with
a
note
of
regret
:
"
Well
,
it
's
gone
now
.
I
suppose
I
could
have
imagined
it
.
"
And
when
,
five
minutes
later
,
they
made
their
way
cautiously
over
the
humpy
grass
into
the
heart
of
the
ruins
there
was
no
one
and
nothing
to
be
seen
.
Without
speaking
they
walked
through
the
gap
of
the
east
window
and
on
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
saw
only
the
moon-bleached
beach
stretching
north
and
south
,
the
thin
fringe
of
white
foam
.
If
anyone
had
been
there
,
thought
Dalgliesh
,
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
for
concealment
behind
the
hunks
of
concrete
or
in
the
crevices
of
the
sandy
cliff
.
There
was
little
point
and
no
real
justification
in
attempting
to
give
chase
,
even
if
they
had
known
the
direction
in
which
he
had
disappeared
.
People
were
entitled
to
walk
alone
at
night
.
Meg
said
again
:
"
I
suppose
I
could
have
imagined
it
,
but
I
do
n't
think
so
.
Anyway

she
's
gone
now

"
She
?
"
"
Oh
yes
.
Did
n't
I
say

had
the
distinct
impression
it
was
a
woman
.
"
By
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
Alice
Mair
woke
with
a
small
despairing
cry
from
her
nightmare
,
the
wind
was
rising
.
She
stretched
out
her
hand
to
click
on
the
bedside
light
,
checked
her
watch
,
then
lay
back
,
panic
subsiding
,
her
eyes
staring
at
the
ceiling
while
the
terrible
immediacy
of
the
dream
began
to
fade
,
recognized
for
what
it
was
,
an
old
spectre
returning
after
all
these
years
,
conjured
up
by
the
events
of
the
night
and
by
the
reiteration
of
the
word
"
murder
"
which
,
since
the
Whistler
had
begun
Iris
work
,
seemed
to
murmur
sonorously
on
the
very
air
.
Gradually
she
reentered
the
real
world
,
manifested
in
the
small
noises
of
the
night
,
the
moan
of
the
wind
in
the
chimneys
,
the
smoothness
of
the
sheet
in
her
clutching
hands
,
the
unnaturally
loud
ticking
of
her
watch
and
,
above
all
,
in
that
oblong
of
pale
light
,
the
open
casement
and
the
drawn
curtains
which
gave
her
a
view
of
the
faintly
luminous
star-studded
sky
.
The
nightmare
needed
no
interpretation
.
It
was
merely
a
new
version
of
an
old
horror
,
less
tenable
than
the
dreams
of
childhood
,
a
more
rational
,
more
adult
terror
.
She
and
Alex
were
children
again
,
the
whole
family
living
with
the
Copleys
at
the
Old
Rectory
.
That
,
in
a
dream
,
was
n't
so
surprising
.
The
Old
Rectory
was
only
a
larger
,
less
pretentious
version
of
Sunnybank
-
ridiculously
named
since
it
had
stood
on
level
ground
and
no
sun
ever
seemed
to
penetrate
its
windows
.
Both
were
late
Victorian
,
built
in
solid
red
brick
,
both
had
a
strong
,
curved
door
under
a
high
,
peaked
porch
,
both
were
isolated
,
each
in
its
own
garden
.
In
the
dream
she
and
her
father
were
walking
together
through
the
shrubbery
.
He
was
carrying
his
billhook
and
was
dressed
as
he
was
on
that
last
dreadful
autumn
afternoon
,
a
singlet
stained
with
his
sweat
,
the
shorts
high
cut
,
showing
as
he
walked
the
bulge
of
the
scrotum
,
the
white
legs
,
matted
with
black
hair
from
the
knees
down
.
She
was
worried
because
she
knew
that
the
Copleys
were
waiting
for
her
to
cook
lunch
.
Mr
Copley
,
robed
in
cassock
and
billowing
surplice
,
was
impatiently
pacing
the
back
lawn
seeming
oblivious
to
their
presence
.
Her
father
was
explaining
something
to
her
in
that
overloud
,
careful
voice
which
he
used
to
her
mother
,
the
voice
which
said
:
"
I
know
you
are
too
stupid
to
understand
this
but
I
will
talk
slowly
and
loudly
and
hope
that
you
wo
n't
try
my
patience
too
far
.
"
He
said
:
"
Alex
wo
n't
get
the
job
now
.
I
'll
see
that
he
does
n't
.
They
wo
n't
appoint
a
man
who
's
murdered
his
own
father
.
"
And
as
he
spoke
he
swung
the
billhook
and
she
saw
that
its
tip
was
red
with
blood
.
Then
suddenly
he
turned
towards
her
,
eyes
blazing
,
lifted
it
,
and
she
felt
its
point
pierce
the
skin
of
her
forehead
,
and
the
sudden
spurt
of
blood
gushing
into
her
eyes
.
Now
wide
awake
,
and
breathing
as
if
she
had
been
running
,
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
brow
and
knew
that
the
cold
wetness
she
felt
was
sweat
not
blood
.
There
was
little
hope
of
falling
asleep
again
;
there
never
was
when
she
woke
in
the
early
hours
.
She
could
get
up
,
put
on
her
dressing
gown
,
go
downstairs
and
make
tea
,
correct
her
proofs
,
read
,
listen
to
the
BBC
World
Service
.
Or
she
could
take
one
of
her
sleeping
tablets
.
God
knew
they
were
powerful
enough
to
knock
her
into
oblivion
.
But
she
was
trying
to
wean
herself
off
them
and
to
give
in
now
would
be
to
acknowledge
the
potency
of
the
nightmare
.
She
would
get
up
and
make
tea
.
She
had
no
fear
of
waking
Alex
.
He
slept
soundly
,
even
through
the
winter
gales
.
But
first
there
was
a
small
act
of
exorcism
to
be
performed
.
If
the
dream
were
to
lose
its
power
,
if
she
were
somehow
to
prevent
it
recurring
,
she
must
face
again
the
memory
of
that
afternoon
nearly
thirty
years
ago
.
It
had
been
a
warm
autumnal
day
in
early
October
and
she
,
Alex
and
her
father
were
working
in
the
garden
.
He
was
Wearing
a
thick
hedge
of
brambles
and
overgrown
shrubs
at
the
bottom
of
the
shrubbery
and
out
of
sight
of
the
house
,
slashing
at
them
with
a
billhook
while
Alex
and
she
dragged
the
freed
branches
clear
ready
to
build
a
bonfire
.
Her
father
was
under
clad
for
the
time
of
year
but
was
sweating
heavily
.
She
saw
the
arm
lifting
and
falling
,
heard
the
crack
of
twigs
,
felt
again
the
thorns
cutting
her
fingers
,
heard
his
high
commands
.
And
then
,
suddenly
,
he
gave
a
cry
.
Either
the
branch
had
been
rotten
or
he
had
missed
his
aim
.
The
billhook
had
sliced
into
his
naked
thigh
and
,
turning
,
she
saw
the
great
curve
of
red
blood
begin
to
bubble
in
the
air
,
saw
him
slowly
sink
like
a
wounded
animal
,
his
hands
plucking
the
air
.
His
right
hand
dropped
the
billhook
and
he
held
it
out
to
her
,
shaking
,
palm
upward
,
and
looked
at
her
beseechingly
,
like
a
child
.
He
tried
to
speak
but
she
could
n't
make
out
the
words
.
She
was
moving
towards
him
,
fascinated
,
when
suddenly
she
felt
a
clutch
on
her
arm
laurels
towards
the
orchard
.
She
cried
:
"
Alex
,
stop
!
He
's
bleeding
.
He
's
dying
.
We
've
got
to
get
help
.
"
She
could
n't
remember
whether
she
actually
said
the
words
.
All
she
later
remembered
was
the
strength
of
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
as
he
forced
her
back
against
the
bark
of
an
apple
tree
and
held
her
there
,
imprisoned
.
And
he
spoke
a
single
word
.
"
No
.
"
Shaking
with
terror
,
her
heart
pounding
,
she
could
n't
have
broken
free
even
if
she
had
wanted
.
And
she
knew
now
that
this
powerlessness
was
important
to
him
.
It
had
been
his
act
and
his
alone
.
Compelled
,
absolved
,
she
had
been
given
no
choice
.
Now
,
thirty
years
later
,
lying
rigid
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sky
,
she
remembered
that
single
word
,
his
eyes
looking
into
hers
,
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
,
the
bark
of
the
tree
scraping
her
back
through
her
Aertex
shirt
.
Time
seemed
to
stop
.
She
could
n't
remember
now
how
long
he
had
held
her
imprisoned
,
only
that
it
seemed
an
eternity
of
immeasurable
time
.
And
then
,
at
last
,
he
gave
a
sigh
and
said
:
"
All
right
.
We
can
go
now
.
"
And
that
,
too
,
amazed
her
,
that
he
should
have
been
thinking
so
clearly
,
calculating
how
long
it
would
take
.
He
dragged
her
after
him
until
they
stood
over
her
father
's
body
.
And
,
looking
down
at
the
still-outstretched
arm
,
the
glazed
and
open
eyes
,
the
great
scarlet
pool
soaking
into
the
earth
,
she
knew
that
it
was
a
body
,
that
he
had
gone
for
ever
,
that
there
was
nothing
she
need
fear
from
him
ever
again
.
Alex
turned
to
her
and
spoke
each
word
loudly
and
clearly
as
if
she
were
a
subnormal
child
.
"
Whatever
he
's
been
doing
to
you
,
he
wo
n't
do
it
again
.
Ever
.
Listen
to
me
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
happened
.
We
left
him
and
went
down
to
climb
the
apple
trees
.
Then
we
decided
that
we
'd
better
get
back
.
Then
we
found
him
.
That
's
all
there
is
,
it
's
as
simple
as
that
.
You
do
n't
need
to
say
anything
else
.
Just
leave
the
talking
to
me
.
Look
at
me
,
look
at
me
,
Alice
.
You
understand
?
"
Her
voice
,
when
it
came
,
sounded
like
an
old
woman
's
voice
,
cracked
and
tremulous
,
and
the
words
strained
her
throat
.
"
Yes
,
I
understand
.
"
And
then
he
was
dragging
her
by
the
hands
,
racing
across
the
lawn
,
nearly
pulling
her
arm
from
its
socket
,
crashing
through
the
kitchen
door
,
crying
aloud
so
that
it
sounded
like
a
whoop
of
triumph
.
She
saw
her
mother
's
face
draining
as
if
she
too
were
bleeding
to
death
,
heard
his
panting
voice
.
"
It
's
Father
.
He
's
had
an
accident
.
Get
a
doctor
quick
.
"
And
then
she
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
.
It
was
very
cold
.
There
were
cold
tiles
under
her
feet
.
The
surface
of
the
wooden
table
on
which
she
rested
her
head
was
cold
to
her
cheeks
.
No
one
came
.
She
was
aware
of
a
voice
telephoning
from
the
hall
,
and
other
voices
,
other
steps
.
Someone
was
crying
.
Now
there
were
more
footsteps
and
the
crunch
of
car
wheels
on
gravel
.
And
Alex
had
been
right
.
It
had
all
been
very
simple
.
No
one
had
questioned
her
,
no
one
had
been
suspicious
.
Their
story
had
been
accepted
.
She
did
n't
go
to
the
inquest
but
Alex
did
,
although
he
never
told
her
what
happened
there
.
Afterwards
some
of
the
people
concerned
,
their
family
doctor
,
the
solicitor
,
a
few
of
her
mother
's
friends
,
came
back
and
there
was
a
curious
tea
party
with
sandwiches
and
home-made
fruitcake
.
They
were
kind
to
her
and
Alex
.
Someone
actually
patted
her
head
.
A
voice
said
,
"
It
was
tragic
that
there
was
no
one
there
.
Common
sense
and
a
rudimentary
knowledge
of
first
aid
would
have
saved
him
.
"
But
now
the
memory
deliberately
evoked
had
completed
its
exorcism
.
The
nightmare
had
been
robbed
of
its
terror
.
With
luck
it
might
not
return
for
months
.
She
swung
her
legs
out
of
bed
and
reached
for
her
dressing
gown
.
She
had
just
poured
the
boiling
water
on
the
tea
and
was
standing
waiting
for
it
to
brew
when
she
heard
Alex
's
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
,
turning
,
she
saw
his
tall
figure
blocking
the
kitchen
door
.
He
looked
boyish
,
almost
vulnerable
,
in
the
familiar
corded
dressing
gown
.
He
pushed
both
hands
through
his
sleep-tousled
hair
.
Surprised
,
because
he
was
usually
a
sound
sleeper
,
she
said
:
"
Did
I
disturb
you
?
Sorry
.
"
"
No
,
I
woke
earlier
and
could
n't
get
off
again
.
Holding
dinner
for
Lessingham
made
it
too
late
for
comfortable
digestion
.
Is
this
fresh
?
"
"
About
ready
to
pour
.
"
He
took
down
a
second
mug
from
the
dresser
and
poured
tea
for
them
both
.
She
seated
herself
in
a
wicker
chair
and
took
her
mug
without
speaking
.
He
said
:
"
The
wind
's
rising
.
"
"
Yes
,
it
has
been
for
the
last
hour
.
"
He
went
over
to
the
door
and
unbolted
the
top
wooden
panel
,
pushing
it
open
.
There
was
a
sensation
of
rushing
white
coldness
,
scentless
,
but
obliterating
the
faint
tang
of
the
tea
and
she
heard
the
low
growling
roar
of
the
sea
.
As
she
listened
it
seemed
to
rise
in
intensity
so
that
she
could
imagine
,
with
an
agreeable
frisson
of
simulated
terror
,
that
the
low
friable
cliffs
had
finally
crumbled
and
that
the
white
foaming
turbulence
was
rolling
towards
them
across
Alex
's
face
.
Looking
at
him
as
he
stared
into
the
night
,
she
felt
a
surge
of
affection
as
pure
and
as
uncomplicated
as
the
flow
of
cold
air
against
her
face
.
Its
fleeting
intensity
surprised
her
.
He
was
so
much
a
part
of
her
that
she
never
needed
nor
wanted
to
examine
too
closely
the
nature
of
her
feeling
for
him
.
She
knew
that
she
was
always
quietly
satisfied
to
have
him
in
the
cottage
,
to
hear
his
footfalls
on
the
floor
above
,
to
share
with
him
the
meal
she
had
cooked
for
herself
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
And
yet
neither
made
demands
of
the
other
.
Even
his
marriage
had
made
no
difference
.
She
had
been
unsurprised
at
the
marriage
since
she
had
rather
liked
Elizabeth
,
but
equally
unsurprised
when
it
ended
.
She
thought
it
unlikely
that
he
would
marry
again
,
but
nothing
between
them
would
change
,
however
many
wives
entered
,
or
attempted
to
enter
,
his
life
.
Sometimes
as
now
she
would
smile
wryly
,
knowing
how
outsiders
saw
their
relationship
.
Those
who
assumed
that
the
cottage
was
owned
by
him
,
not
her
,
saw
her
as
the
unmarried
sister
,
dependent
on
him
for
houseroom
,
companionship
,
a
purpose
in
life
.
Others
,
more
perceptive
but
still
nowhere
near
the
truth
,
were
intrigued
by
their
apparent
independence
of
each
other
,
their
casual
comings
and
goings
,
their
non-involvement
.
She
remembered
Elizabeth
saying
in
the
first
weeks
of
her
engagement
to
Alex
,
"
Do
you

,
you
're
a
rather
intimidating
couple
?
"
and
she
had
been
tempted
to
reply
,
"
Oh
,
we
are
,
we
are
.
"
She
had
bought
Martyr
's
Cottage
before
his
appointment
as
Director
of
the
power
station
and
he
had
moved
in
by
an
unspoken
agreement
that
this
was
a
temporary
expedient
while
he
decided
what
to
do
,
keep
on
the
Barbican
flat
as
his
main
home
or
sell
the
flat
and
buy
a
house
in
Norwich
and
a
smaller
pied
a
terre
in
London
.
He
was
essentially
an
urban
creature
;
she
did
n't
see
him
settling
permanently
other
than
in
a
city
.
If
,
with
the
new
job
,
he
moved
back
to
London
she
would
n't
follow
him
,
and
nor
,
she
knew
,
would
he
expect
her
to
.
Here
on
this
sea-scoured
coast
she
had
at
last
found
a
place
which
she
was
content
to
call
home
.
That
he
could
walk
in
and
out
of
it
unannounced
never
made
it
less
than
her
own
.
It
must
,
she
thought
sipping
her
tea
,
have
been
after
one
o'clock
when
he
returned
from
seeing
Hilary
Robarts
home
.
She
wondered
what
had
kept
him
.
Sleeping
lightly
as
always
in
the
early
hours
,
she
had
heard
his
key
in
the
lock
,
his
foot
on
the
stairs
,
before
drifting
again
into
sleep
.
Now
it
was
getting
on
for
five
o'clock
.
He
could
n't
have
had
more
than
a
few
hours
"
sleep
.
Now
,
as
if
suddenly
aware
of
the
morning
chill
,
he
closed
the
top
half
of
the
door
,
drove
home
the
bolt
,
then
came
and
stretched
himself
out
in
the
armchair
opposite
her
.
Leaning
back
,
he
cradled
his
mug
in
his
hands
.
He
said
:
"
It
's
a
nuisance
that
Caroline
Amphlett
does
n't
want
to
leave
Larksoken
.
I
do
n't
relish
beginning
a
new
job
,
particularly
this
job
,
with
an
unknown
PA
.
Caroline
knows
the
way
I
work
.
I
'd
rather
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
'd
come
to
London
with
me
.
It
's
inconvenient
.
"
And
it
was
,
she
suspected
,
rather
more
than
inconvenient
.
Pride
,
even
personal
prestige
,
were
also
at
stake
.
Other
senior
men
took
their
personal
assistants
with
them
when
changing
jobs
.
The
reluctance
of
a
secretary
to
be
parted
from
her
boss
was
a
flattering
affirmation
of
personal
dedication
.
She
could
sympathize
with
his
chagrin
but
it
was
hardly
enough
to
keep
him
awake
at
night
.
He
added
:
"
Personal
reasons
,
or
so
she
says
.
That
means
Jonathan
Reeves
,
presumably
.
God
knows
what
she
sees
in
him
.
The
man
is
n't
even
a
good
technician
.
"
Alice
Mair
controlled
her
smile
.
She
said
:
'l
doubt
whether
her
interest
in
him
is
technical
.
"
"
Well
,
if
it
's
sexual

less
discrimination

.
"
He
was
n't
,
she
told
herself
,
a
poor
judge
of
men
or
women
.
He
rarely
made
fundamental
mistakes
and
never
,
she
suspected
,
about
a
man
's
scientific
ability
.
But
he
had
no
understanding
of
the
extraordinary
complexities
and
irrationalities
of
human
motives
,
human
behaviour
.
He
knew
that
the
universe
was
complex
but
that
it
obeyed
certain
rules
,
although
,
she
supposed
,
he
would
n't
have
used
the
word
"
obey
"
with
its
implication
of
conscious
choice
.
This
,
he
would
say
,
is
how
the
physical
world
behaves
.
It
is
open
to
human
reason
and
,
to
a
limited
extent
,
to
human
control
.
People
disconcerted
him
because
they
could
surprise
him
.
Most
disconcerting
of
all
was
the
fact
that
he
occasionally
surprised
himself
.
He
would
have
been
at
home
as
a
sixteenth-century
Elizabethan
,
categorizing
people
according
to
their
essential
natures
;
choleric
,
melancholic
,
mercurial
,
saturnine
,
qualities
mirroring
the
planets
that
governed
their
birth
.
That
basic
fact
established
,
then
you
knew
where
you
were
.
And
yet
it
could
still
surprise
him
that
a
man
could
be
a
sensible
and
reliable
scientist
in
his
work
and
a
fool
with
women
,
could
show
judgement
in
one
area
of
his
life
and
act
like
an
irrational
child
in
another
.
Now
he
was
peeved
because
his
secretary
,
whom
he
had
categorized
as
intelligent
,
sensible
,
dedicated
,
preferred
to
stay
in
Norfolk
with
her
lover
,
a
man
he
despised
,
rather
than
follow
him
to
London
.
She
said
:

"
"

attractive

Chapel

He
asked
,
but
without
real
curiosity
:

She
said
no
more
,
knowing
that
he
was
n't
particularly
interested
,
that
his
mind
had
moved
elsewhere
.
And
yet
,
looking
back
,
it
had
been
an
odd
encounter
.
Caroline
's
blonde
hair
had
been
bundled
under
a
large
beret
and
she
was
wearing
spectacles
.
But
the
disguise
,
if
it
were
meant
as
a
disguise
,
had
been
ineffective
.
She
herself
had
moved
on
swiftly
,
anxious
not
to
be
recognized
or
to
seem
a
spy
.
A
minute
later
she
had
seen
the
girl
slowly
walking
along
the
aisle
,
guidebook
in
hand
,
the
man
strolling
behind
her
carefully
distanced
.
They
had
moved
together
and
had
stood
in
front
of
a
monument
,
seemingly
absorbed
.
And
when
,
ten
minutes
later
,
Alice
was
leaving
the
cathedral
she
had
glimpsed
him
again
.
This
time
it
was
he
who
was
carrying
the
guidebook
.
He
made
no
further
comment
about
Caroline
but
after
a
minute
's
silence

the

echo

the

the
day

stove
so
heavy
that
Meg
was
unable
to
move
it
to
clean
behind
it
and
preferred
not
to
think
of
the
accumulated
grease
of
decades
gumming
it
to
the
wall
.
Under
the
window
was
deep
porcelain
sink
stained
with
the
detritus
of
seventy
years
'
washing-up
and
impossible
to
clean
adequately
.
The
floor
was
of
ancient
stone
slabs
,
hard
on
the
feet
,
from
which
in
winter
there
seemed
to
rise
a
damp
,
foot-numbing
miasma
.
The
wall
opposite
the
sink
and
the
window
was
covered
with
an
oak
dresser
,
very
old
and
probably
valuable
,
if
it
had
been
possible
to
remove
it
from
the
wall
without
its
collapse
,
and
the
original
row
of
bells
still
hung
over
the
door
each
with
its
Gothic
script
;
drawing
room
,
dining
room
,
study
,
nursery
.
It
was
a
kitchen
to
challenge
rather
than
enhance
the
skills
of
any
cook
ambitious
beyond
the
boiling
of
eggs
.
But
now
Meg
hardly
noticed
its
deficiencies
.
Like
the
rest
of
the
Old
Rectory
it
had
become
home
.
After
the
stridency
and
aggression
of
the
school
,
the
hate-mail
,
she
was
happy
to
find
her
temporary
asylum
in
this
gentle
household
where
voices
were
never
raised
,
where
no
one
obsessively
analysed
her
every
sentence
in
the
hope
of
detecting
racist
,
sexist
or
fascist
undertones
,
where
words
meant
what
they
had
meant
for
generations
,
where
obscenities
were
unknown
or
at
least
unspoken
,
where
there
was
the
grace
of
good
order
symbolized
for
her
in
Mr
Copley
's
reading
of
the
Church
's
daily
offices
,
Morning
Prayer
and
Evensong
.
Sometimes
she
saw
the
three
of
them
as
expatriates
,
stranded
in
some
remote
colony
,
obstinately
adhering
to
old
customs
,
a
lost
way
of
life
,
as
they
did
to
old
forms
of
worship
.
And
she
had
grown
to
like
both
her
employers
.
She
would
have
respected
Simon
Copley
more
if
he
had
been
less
prone
to
venial
selfishness
,
less
preoccupied
with
his
physical
comfort
,
but
this
she
told
herself
was
probably
the
result
of
fifty
years
of
spoiling
by
a
devoted
wife
.
And
he
loved
his
wife
.
He
relied
on
her
.
He
respected
her
judgement
.
How
lucky
they
were
,
she
thought
;
secure
in
each
other
's
affection
and
presumably
fortified
in
increasing
age
by
the
certainty
that
if
they
were
n't
granted
the
grace
of
death
on
the
same
day
there
would
be
no
lasting
separation
.
But
did
they
really
believe
this
?
She
would
like
to
have
asked
them
,
but
knew
that
it
would
have
been
impossibly
presumptuous
.
Surely
they
must
have
some
doubts
,
made
some
mental
reservations
to
the
creed
they
so
confidently
recited
morning
and
night
.
But
perhaps
what
mattered
at
eighty
was
habit
,
the
body
no
longer
interested
in
sex
,
the
mind
no
longer
interested
in
speculation
,
the
smaller
things
in
life
mattering
more
than
the
large
and
,
in
the
end
,
the
slow
realization
that
nothing
really
mattered
at
all
.
The
job
was
n't
arduous
,
but
she
knew
that
gradually
she
was
taking
on
much
more
than
the
advertisement
had
suggested
and
she
sensed
that
the
main
anxiety
of
their
life
was
whether
she
would
stay
.
Their
daughter
had
provided
all
the
labour-saving
devices
:
dishwasher
,
washing
machine
,
spin-dryer
,
all
housed
in
a
disused
still
room
near
the
back
door
,
although
until
she
came
the
Copleys
had
been
reluctant
to
use
them
in
case
they
could
n't
turn
them
off
,
visualizing
the
machines
whirling
away
all
night
,
overheating
,
blowing
up
,
the
whole
rectory
pulsating
with
an
uncontrollable
power
.
Their
only
child
lived
in
a
manor
house
in
Wiltshire
and
rarely
visited
,
although
she
telephoned
frequently
,
usually
at
inconvenient
times
.
It
was
she
who
had
interviewed
Meg
for
the
Old
Rectory
and
Meg
now
found
it
difficult
to
connect
that
confident
,
tweeded
,
slightly
aggressive
woman
with
the
two
gentle
old
people
she
knew
.
And
she
knew
,
although
they
would
never
have
dreamt
of
telling
her
,
perhaps
did
n't
even
admit
it
to
themselves
,
that
they
were
afraid
of
her
.
She
bullied
them
,
as
she
would
have
claimed
,
for
their
own
good
.
Their
second
greatest
fear
was
that
they
might
be
forced
to
comply
with
her
frequently
telephoned
suggestion
,
made
purely
from
a
sense
of
duty
,
that
they
should
go
to
stay
with
her
until
the
Whistler
was
caught
.
Unlike
their
daughter
,
Meg
could
understand
why
,
after
retirement
,
they
had
used
all
their
savings
to
buy
the
rectory
and
had
in
old
age
burdened
themselves
with
a
mortgage
.
Mr
Copley
had
in
youth
been
a
curate
at
Larksoken
when
the
Victorian
church
was
still
standing
.
It
was
in
that
ugly
repository
of
polished
pine
,
acoustic
tiles
and
garish
,
sentimental
stained
glass
that
he
and
his
wife
had
been
married
,
and
in
a
flat
in
the
rectory
,
living
above
the
parish
priest
,
that
they
had
made
their
first
home
.
The
church
had
been
partly
demolished
by
a
devastating
gale
in
the
1930s
,
to
the
secret
relief
of
the
Church
Commissioners
who
had
been
considering
what
to
do
with
a
building
of
absolutely
no
architectural
merit
serving
a
congregation
at
the
major
festivals
of
six
at
the
most
.
So
the
church
had
been
finally
demolished
and
the
Old
Rectory
,
sheltering
behind
it
and
proving
more
durable
,
had
been
sold
.
Rosemary
Duncan-Smith
had
made
her
views
plain
when
driving
Meg
back
to
Norwich
station
after
her
interview
.
"
It
's
ridiculous
for
them
to
be
living
there
at
all
,
of
course
.
They
should
have
looked
for
a
two-bedded
,
well-equipped
flat
in
Norwich
or
in
a
convenient
village
close
to
the
shops
and
post
office
,
and
to
a
church
,
of
course
.
But
Father
can
be
remarkably
obstinate
when
he
thinks
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
Mother
is
putty
in
his
hands
.
I
hope
you
are
n't
seeing
this
job
as
a
temporary
expedient
.
"
Meg
had
replied
:
"
Temporary
,
but
not
short-term
.
I
ca
n't
promise
that
I
'll
stay
permanently
,
but
I
need
time
and
peace
to
decide
on
my
future
.
And
I
may
not
suit
your
parents
.
"
"
Time
and
peace
.
We
'd
all
be
glad
of
that
.
Well
,
I
suppose
it
's
better
than
nothing
,
but
I
'd
be
grateful
for
a
month
or
two
's
notice
when
you
do
decide
to
go
.
And
I
should
n't
worry
about
suiting
.
With
an
inconvenient
house
and
stuck
out
on
that
headland
with
nothing
to
look
at
but
a
ruined
abbey
and
that
atomic
power
station
they
'll
have
to
put
up
with
what
they
can
get
.
"
But
that
had
been
sixteen
months
ago
and
she
was
still
here
.
But
it
was
in
that
beautifully
designed
and
equipped
,
but
comfortable
and
homely
kitchen
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
that
she
had
found
her
healing
.
Early
in
their
friendship
,
when
Alice
had
to
spend
a
week
in
London
and
Alex
was
away
,
she
had
given
Meg
one
of
her
spare
keys
to
the
cottage
so
that
she
could
go
in
to
collect
and
forward
her
post
.
On
her
return
,
when
Meg
offered
it
back
,
she
had
said
:
"
Better
keep
it
.
You
may
need
it
again
.
"
Meg
had
never
again
used
it
.
The
door
was
usually
open
in
summer
and
,
when
shut
,
she
would
always
ring
.
But
its
possession
,
the
sight
and
weight
of
it
on
her
key
ring
,
had
come
to
symbolize
for
her
the
certainty
and
the
trust
of
their
friendship
.
She
had
been
so
long
without
a
woman
friend
.
She
had
forgotten
,
sometimes
she
told
herself
,
that
she
had
never
before
known
the
comfort
of
a
close
,
undemanding
,
asexual
companionship
with
another
woman
.
Before
the
accidental
drowning
of
her
husband
four
years
earlier
,
she
and
Martin
had
needed
only
the
occasional
companionship
of
friendly
acquaintances
to
affirm
their
self-sufficiency
.
Theirs
had
been
one
of
those
childless
,
self-absorbing
marriages
which
unconsciously
repel
attempts
at
intimacy
.
The
occasional
dinner
party
was
a
social
duty
;
they
could
hardly
wait
to
get
back
to
the
seclusion
of
their
own
small
house
.
And
after
his
death
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
walked
in
darkness
like
an
automaton
through
a
deep
and
narrow
canyon
of
grief
in
which
all
her
energies
,
all
her
physical
strength
,
had
been
husbanded
to
get
through
each
day
.
She
thought
and
worked
and
grieved
only
for
a
day
at
a
time
.
To
allow
herself
even
to
think
of
the
days
,
the
weeks
,
the
months
or
years
stretching
ahead
would
have
been
to
precipitate
disaster
.
For
two
years
she
had
hardly
been
sane
.
Even
her
Christianity
was
of
little
help
.
She
did
n't
reject
it
,
but
it
had
become
irrelevant
,
its
comfort
only
a
candle
which
served
fitfully
to
illumine
the
dark
.
But
when
,
after
those
two
years
,
the
valley
had
almost
imperceptibly
widened
and
there
was
for
the
first
time
,
not
those
black
enclosing
cliffs
,
but
the
vista
of
a
normal
life
,
even
of
happiness
,
a
landscape
over
which
it
was
possible
to
believe
the
sun
might
shine
,
she
had
become
unwittingly
embroiled
in
the
racial
politics
of
her
school
.
The
older
members
of
staff
had
moved
or
retired
,
and
the
new
headmistress
,
specifically
appointed
to
enforce
the
fashionable
orthodoxies
,
had
moved
in
with
crusading
zeal
to
smell
out
and
eradicate
heresy
.
Meg
realized
now
that
she
had
,
from
the
first
,
been
the
obvious
,
the
predestined
victim
.
She
had
fled
to
this
new
life
on
the
headland
and
to
a
different
solitude
.
And
here
she
had
found
Alice
Mair
.
They
had
met
a
fortnight
after
Meg
's
arrival
when
Alice
had
called
at
the
Old
Rectory
with
a
suitcase
of
jumble
for
the
annual
sale
in
aid
of
St
Andrew
's
Church
in
Lydsett
.
There
was
an
unused
scullery
leading
off
a
passage
between
the
kitchen
and
the
back
door
which
was
used
as
a
collecting
point
for
unwanted
items
from
the
headland
;
clothes
,
bric-a-brac
,
books
and
old
magazines
.
Mr
Copley
took
an
occasional
service
at
St
Andrew
's
when
Mr
Smollett
,
the
vicar
,
was
on
holiday
,
an
involvement
in
church
and
village
life
which
,
Meg
suspected
,
was
as
important
to
him
as
it
was
to
the
church
.
Normally
,
little
jumble
could
be
expected
from
the
few
cottages
on
the
headland
,
but
Alex
Mair
,
anxious
to
associate
the
power
station
with
the
community
,
had
put
up
a
notice
on
the
staff
board
and
the
two
tea
chests
were
usually
fairly
full
by
the
time
the
October
sale
came
round
.
The
back
door
of
the
Old
Rectory
,
giving
access
to
the
scullery
,
was
normally
left
open
during
daylight
hours
and
an
inner
door
to
the
house
locked
,
but
Alice
Mair
had
knocked
at
the
front
door
and
made
herself
known
.
The
two
women
,
close
in
age
,
both
reserved
,
both
independent
,
neither
deliberately
seeking
a
friend
,
had
liked
each
other
.
The
next
week
Meg
had
received
an
invitation
to
dinner
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
And
now
there
was
rarely
a
day
when
she
did
n't
walk
the
half
mile
over
the
headland
to
sit
in
Alice
's
kitchen
and
talk
and
watch
while
she
worked
.
Her
colleagues
at
school
would
,
she
knew
,
have
found
their
friendship
incomprehensible
.
Friendship
there
,
or
what
passed
for
friendship
,
never
crossed
the
great
divide
of
political
allegiance
and
in
the
acrimonious
clamour
of
the
staffroom
could
swiftly
deteriorate
into
gossip
,
rumours
,
recriminations
and
betrayal
.
This
peaceable
friendship
,
asking
nothing
,
was
as
devoid
of
intensity
as
it
was
of
anxiety
.
It
was
not
a
demonstrative
friendship
;
they
had
never
kissed
,
had
never
indeed
touched
hands
except
at
that
first
meeting
.
Meg
was
n't
sure
what
it
was
that
Alice
valued
in
her
,
but
she
knew
what
she
valued
in
Alice
.
Intelligent
,
well-read
,
unsentimental
,
unshockable
,
she
had
become
the
focus
of
Meg
's
life
on
the
headland
.
She
seldom
saw
Alex
Mair
.
During
the
day
he
was
at
the
power
station
and
at
weekends
,
reversing
the
normal
peregrination
,
he
was
at
his
London
flat
,
frequently
staying
there
for
Part
of
the
week
if
he
had
a
meeting
in
town
.
She
had
never
felt
that
Alice
had
deliberately
kept
them
apart
,
fearing
that
her
brother
would
be
bored
by
her
friend
.
In
spite
of
all
the
traumas
of
the
last
four
years
Meg
's
inner
self
was
too
confidently
rooted
to
be
prone
to
that
kind
of
sexual
or
social
self-abasement
.
But
she
had
never
felt
at
home
with
him
,
perhaps
because
,
with
his
confident
good
looks
and
the
air
of
arrogance
in
his
bearing
,
he
seemed
both
to
represent
and
to
have
absorbed
something
of
the
mystery
and
potency
of
the
power
he
operated
.
He
was
perfectly
amiable
to
her
on
the
few
occasions
when
they
did
meet
;
sometimes
she
even
felt
that
he
liked
her
.
But
their
only
common
ground
was
in
the
kitchen
of
Martyr
's
Cottage
and
even
there
she
was
always
more
at
home
when
he
was
away
.
Alice
never
spoke
of
him
except
casually
but
on
the
few
occasions
,
like
last
night
's
dinner
party
,
when
she
had
seen
them
together
they
seemed
to
have
the
intuitive
mutual
awareness
,
an
instinctive
response
to
the
other
's
needs
,
more
typical
of
a
long-standing
successful
marriage
than
of
an
apparently
casual
fraternal
relationship
.
And
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
years
she
had
been
able
to
talk
about
Martin
.
She
remembered
that
July
day
,
the
kitchen
door
open
to
the
patio
,
the
scent
of
herbs
and
sea
stronger
even
than
the
spicy
,
buttery
smell
of
newly
baked
biscuits
.
She
and
Alice
had
sat
opposite
each
other
,
across
the
kitchen
table
,
the
teapot
between
them
.
She
could
remember
every
word
.
"
He
did
n't
get
many
thanks
.
Oh
,
they
said
how
heroic
he
was
and
the
headmaster
said
all
the
right
things
at
the
school
memorial
service
.
But
they
thought
that
the
boys
should
n't
have
been
swimming
there
anyway
.
The
school
disclaimed
any
responsibility
for
his
death
.
They
were
more
anxious
to
escape
criticism
than
to
honour
Martin
.
And
the
boy
he
saved
has
n't
turned
out
very
well
.
I
suppose
I
'm
silly
to
worry
about
that
.
"
"
It
would
be
perfectly
natural
to
hope
that
your
husband
had
n't
died
for
someone
second-rate
,
but
I
suppose
the
boy
has
a
point
of
view
.
It
could
be
an
awesome
responsibility
knowing
that
someone
has
died
for
you
.

Meg
said
:
"
I
tried
to
tell
myself
that
.
For
a
time
I
was
-
well
,
almost
obsessed
with
that
boy
.
I
used
to
hang
about
the
school
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
.
Sometimes
I
had
the
need
almost
to
touch
him
.
It
was
as
if
some
part
of
Martin
had
Passed
into
him
.
But
he
was
only
embarrassed
,

course
.
He
did
n't
want
to
see
me
or
talk
to
me
,
he
or
his
parents
.
He
was
n't
,
in

,
a
very
nice
boy

a
bully
and
rather
stupid

do

Martin
even
liked

he
never

the

business
about
her
obsession
with

she

never

Recalled
to
the
present
by
the
cold
of
the
flagstones
numbing
her
feet
and
automatically
aligning
the
cup
handles
,
she
suddenly
realized
why
she
had
remembered
that
summer
teatime
in
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
The
biscuits
she
would
add
to
the
tray
next
morning
were
a
later
batch
of
the
same
recipe
provided
by
Alice
.
But
she
would
n't
take
them
from
the
tin
until
tomorrow
.
There
was
nothing
more
to
do
tonight
except
to
fill
her
hot-water
bottle
.
There
was
no
central
heating
in
the
Old
Rectory
and
she
seldom
switched
on
the
two-bar
electric
fire
in
her
bedroom
,
knowing
how
worried
the
Copleys
were
by
their
her
bills
.
Finally
,
hugging
the
bottle
's
warmth
to
her
chest
,
she
checked
on
the
bolts
of
the
front
and
back
doors
and
made
her
way
up
the
uncarpeted
stairs
to
bed
.
On
the
landing
she
met
Mrs
Copley
,
dressing-gowned
,
scurrying
furtively
to
the
bathroom
.
Although
there
was
a
cloakroom
on
the
ground
floor
the
Old
Rectory
had
only
one
bathroom
,
a
defect
which
necessitated
embarrassed
,
low-voiced
inquiries
before
anyone
upset
their
carefully
worked
out
rota
by
taking
an
unexpected
bath
.
Meg
waited
until
she
heard
the
main
bedroom
door
shut
before
going
herself
to
the
bathroom
.
Fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
in
bed
.
She
knew
rather
than
felt
that
she
was
very
tired
and
recognized
the
symptoms
of
an
overstimulated
brain
in
an
exhausted
body
,
the
restless
limbs
and
inability
to
get
comfortable
.
The
Old
Rectory
was
too
far
inland
for
her
to
hear
the
crash
of
the
waves
but
the
smell
and
the
throb
of
the
sea
were
always
present
.
In
summer
the
headland
would
vibrate
with
a
gentle
rhythmic
humming
which
,
on
stormy
nights
or
at
the
spring
tides
would
rise
to
an
angry
moan
.
She
slept
always
with
her
window
open
and
would
drift
into
sleep
soothed
by
that
distant
murmur
.
But
tonight
it
had
no
power
to
lull
her
into
unconsciousness
.
Her
bedside
book
,
often
reread
,
was
Anthony
Trollope
's
The
Small
House
at
Allington
but
tonight
it
could
no
longer
translate
her
to
the
reassuring
,
comfortable
,
nostalgic
world
of
Barsetshire
,
to
croquet
on
Mrs
Dale
's
lawn
and
dinner
at
the
squire
's
table
.
The
memories
of
the
evening
were
too
traumatic
,
too
exciting
,
too
recent
to
be
easily
assuaged
by
sleep
.
She
opened
her
eyes
to
the
darkness
,
a
darkness
too
often
populated
before
sleep
by
those
familiar
,
reproachful
,
childish
faces
,
brown
,
black
and
white
,
bending
over
her
,
asking
why
she
had
deserted
them
when
they
loved
her
and
thought
that
she
had
loved
them
.
Usually
it
was
a
relief
to
be
free
of
those
gentle
and
accusing
ghosts
,
which
in
the
last
few
months
had
visited
her
less
often
.
And
sometimes
they
were
replaced
by
a
more
traumatic
memory
.
The
headmistress
had
tried
to
insist
that
she
go
on
a
racial
awareness
course
,
she
who
had
taught
children
of
different
races
for
over
twenty
years
.
There
was
one
scene
which
for
months
she
had
tried
resolutely
to
put
out
of
her
mind
,
that
last
meeting
in
the
staffroom
,
the
circle
of
implacable
faces
,
brown
,
black
and
white
,
the
accusing
eyes
,
the
insistent
questions
.
And
in
the
end
,
worn
down
by
bullying
,
she
had
found
herself
helplessly
weeping
.
No
nervous
breakdown
,
that
useful
euphemism
,
had
been
more
humiliating
.
But
tonight
even
that
shameful
memory
was
replaced
by
more
recent
and
more
disquieting
visions
.
She
glimpsed
again
that
girlish
figure
momentarily
outlined
against
the
walls
of
the
abbey
only
to
slip
away
like
a
wraith
and
be
lost
among
the
shadows
of
the
beach
.
She
sat
again
at
the
dinner
table
and
saw
in
the
candlelight
Hilary
Robarts
's
dark
,
discontented
eyes
staring
intently
at
Alex
Mair
;
watched
the
planes
of
Miles
Lessingham
's
face
fitfully
lit
by
the
leaping
flames
of
the
fire
,
saw
his
long-fingered
hands
reaching
down
for
the
bottle
of
claret
,
heard
again
that
measured
rather
high
voice
speaking
the
unspeakable
.
And
then
,
on
the
verge
of
sleep
,
she
was
crashing
with
him
through
the
bushes
of
that
dreadful
wood
,
feeling
the
briars
scratching
her
legs
,
the
low
twigs
whipping
against
her
cheeks
,
staring
with
him
as
the
pool
of
light
from
the
torch
shone
down
on
that
grotesque
and
mutilated
face
.
And
in
that
twilight
world
between
waking
and
sleeping
she
saw
that
it
was
a
face
she
knew
,
her
own
.
she
jerked
back
to
consciousness
with
a
little
cry
of
began
resolutely
to
read
.
Half
an
hour
later
,
the
book
slipped
out
of
her
hand
and
she
fell
into
the
first
of
the
night
's
uneasy
periods
of
slumber
.
It
took
only
two
minutes
of
lying
stretched
and
rigid
on
his
bed
for
Alex
Mair
to
realize
that
sleep
was
unlikely
to
come
.
To
lie
in
bed
wakeful
had
always
been
intolerable
to
him
.
He
could
manage
with
little
sleep
but
that
was
invariably
sound
.
Now
he
swung
his
legs
out
of
bed
,
reached
for
his
dressing
gown
and
walked
over
to
the
window
.
He
would
watch
the
sun
rise
over
the
North
Sea
.
He
thought
back
over
the
last
few
hours
,
the
acknowledged
relief
of
talking
to
Alice
,
the
knowledge
that
nothing
shocked
her
,
nothing
surprised
her
,
that
everything
he
did
,
if
not
right
in
her
eyes
,
was
judged
by
a
different
standard
from
the
one
she
rigorously
applied
to
the
rest
of
her
life
.
The
secret
that
lay
between
them
,
those
minutes
when
he
had
held
her
shaking
body
against
the
tree
trunk
and
stared
into
her
eyes
,
compelling
obedience
,
had
bound
them
with
a
cord
so
strong
that
it
could
n't
be
frayed
,
either
by
the
enormity
of
their
shared
guilty
secret
,
or
by
the
small
rubs
of
living
together
.
And
yet
they
had
never
spoken
of
their
father
's
death
.
He
did
n't
know
whether
Alice
ever
thought
of
it
,
or
whether
the
trauma
had
erased
it
from
her
mind
so
that
she
now
believed
the
version
he
had
formulated
,
had
taken
the
lie
into
her
unconscious
and
made
it
her
truth
.
When
,
quite
soon
after
the
funeral
,
seeing
how
calm
she
was
,
he
had
imagined
that
possibility
he
had
been
surprised
at
his
reluctance
to
believe
it
.
He
did
n't
want
her
gratitude
.
It
was
degrading
even
to
contemplate
that
she
would
feel
an
obligation
towards
him
.
Obligation
and
gratitude
were
words
they
had
never
needed
to
use
.
But
he
did
want
her
to
know
and
to
remember
.
The
deed
was
to
him
so
monstrous
,
so
surprising
,
that
it
would
have
been
intolerable
not
to
have
shared
it
with
a
living
soul
.
In
those
early
months
he
had
wanted
her
to
know
the
magnitude
of
what
he
had
done
and
that
he
had
done
it
for
her
.
And
then
,
six
weeks
after
the
funeral
,
he
had
suddenly
found
himself
able
to
believe
that
it
had
n't
happened
,
not
in
that
way
,
and
that
the
whole
horror
was
a
childhood
fantasy
.
He
would
lie
awake
at
night
and
see
his
father
's
crumbling
figure
,
the
leap
of
blood
like
a
scarlet
fountain
,
would
hear
the
harshly
whispered
words
.
In
this
revised
and
comforting
version
there
had
been
a
second
of
delay
,
no
more
,
and
then
he
had
raced
for
the
house
shouting
for
help
.
And
there
was
a
second
and
even
more
admirable
fantasy
in
which
he
had
knelt
at
his
father
's
side
,
had
pressed
his
clenched
fist
hard
into
the
groin
,
quenching
the
spurting
blood
,
had
whispered
reassurance
into
those
dying
eyes
.
It
had
been
too
late
,
of
course
;
but
he
had
tried
.
He
had
done
his
best
.
The
coroner
had
praised
him
,
that
precise
little
man
with
his
half-moon
spectacles
,
his
face
like
a
querulous
parrot
.
"
I
congratulate
the
deceased
's
son
who
acted
with
commendable
promptness
and
courage
and
did
everything
possible
to
try
to
save
his
father
's
life
.
"
The
relief
of
being
able
to
believe
in
his
innocence
was
at
first
so
great
that
temporarily
it
overwhelmed
him
.
He
had
lain
in
bed
night
after
night
drifting
into
sleep
on
a
tide
of
euphoria
.
But
he
had
known
,
even
then
,
that
this
self-administered
absolution
was
like
a
drug
in
the
bloodstream
.
It
was
comforting
and
easy
,
but
it
was
n't
for
him
.
That
way
lay
a
danger
more
destructive
even
than
guilt
.
He
had
told
himself
:
"
I
must
never
believe
that
a
lie
is
the
truth
.
I
may
tell
lies
all
my
life
if
it
's
expedient
but
I
must
know
them
for
what
they
are
and
I
must
never
tell
them
to
myself
.
Facts
are
facts
.
I
have
to
accept
them
and
face
them
and
then
I
can
learn
how
to
deal
with
them
.
I
can
look
for
reasons
for
what
I
did
and
call
those
reasons
excuses
;
what
he
did
to
Alice
,
how
he
bullied
Mother
,
how
I
hated
him
.
I
can
attempt
to
justify
his
death
at
least
to
myself
.
But
I
did
what
I
did
and
he
died
as
he
died
.
"
And
with
that
acceptance
came
a
kind
of
peace
.
After
a
few
years
he
was
able
to
believe
that
guilt
itself
was
an
indulgence
,
that
he
did
n't
need
to
suffer
it
unless
he
chose
.
And
then
there
came
a
time
when
he
felt
a
pride
in
the
deed
,
in
the
courage
,
the
audacity
,
the
resolution
which
had
made
it
possible
.
But
that
,
too
,
he
knew
was
dangerous
.
And
for
years
afterwards
he
hardly
thought
of
his
father
.
Neither
his
mother
nor
Alice
ever
spoke
of
him
except
in
the
company
of
casual
acquaintances
who
felt
the
need
to
utter
embarrassed
condolences
from
which
there
was
no
escape
.
But
in
the
family
only
once
was
his
name
mentioned
.
A
year
after
the
death
his
mother
had
married
Edmund
Morgan
,
a
widowed
church
organist
of
mind-numbing
dullness
,
and
had
retired
with
him
to
Bognor
Regis
where
they
lived
on
his
father
's
insurance
money
in
a
spacious
bungalow
in
sight
of
the
sea
,
in
an
obsessive
mutual
devotion
which
mirrored
the
meticulous
order
and
tidiness
of
their
world
.
His
mother
always
spoke
of
her
new
husband
as
Mr
Morgan
.
"
If
I
do
n't
talk
to
you
about
your
father
,
Alex
,
it
is
n't
that
I
've
forgotten
him
,
but
Mr
Morgan
would
n't
like
it
.
"
The
phrase
had
become
a
catchword
between
him
and
Alice
.
The
conjunction
of
Morgan
's
job
and
his
instrument
offered
endless
possibilities
of
adolescent
jokes
,
particularly
when
he
and
-their
mother
were
on
honeymoon
.
"
I
expect
Mr
Morgan
is
pulling
out
all
Iris
stops
.
"
"
Do
you
suppose
Mr
Morgan
is
changing
his
combinations
?
"
"
Poor
Mr
Morgan
,
labouring
away
.
I
hope
he
does
n't
run
out
of
wind
.
"
They
were
wary
,
reticent
children
,
yet
this
joke
would
reduce
them
to
screams
of
helpless
laughter
.
Mr
Morgan
and
his
organ
releasing
them
into
hysterical
laughter
had
anaesthetized
the
horror
of
the
past
.
And
then
,
when
he
was
about
eighteen
,
reality
of
another
kind
intruded
itself
and
he
said
aloud
,
"
I
did
n't
do
it
for
Alice
,
I
did
it
for
myself
"
,
and
thought
how
extraordinary
it
was
that
it
had
taken
four
years
to
discover
that
fact
.
And
yet
was
it
a
fact
,
was
it
the
truth
,
or
was
it
merely
a
psychological
speculation
which
in
certain
moods
he
found
it
interesting
to
contemplate
?
Now
,
looking
out
over
the
heartland
to
the
eastern
sky
already
flushed
with
the
first
faint
gold
of
dawn
,
he
said
aloud
:
"
I
let
my
father
die
deliberately
.
That
is
a
fact
.
All
the
rest
is
pointless
speculation
.
"
In
fiction
,
he
thought
,
Alice
and
I
should
have
been
tormented
by
our
joint
knowledge
,
distrustful
,
guilt-ridden
,
unable
to
live
apart
yet
miserable
together
.
Yet
since
his
father
's
death
there
had
been
nothing
between
him
and
his
sister
but
companionship
,
affection
,
peace
.
But
now
,
nearly
thirty
years
later
,
when
he
thought
he
had
long
come
to
terms
with
the
deed
and
his
own
reaction
to
it
,
memory
had
begun
to
stir
again
.
It
had
started
with
the
first
Whistler
murder
.
The
word
"
murder
"
itself
constantly
on
someone
's
lips
,
like
a
sonorous
curse
,
seemed
to
have
the
power
to
evoke
those
half-suppressed
images
of
his
father
's
face
which
had
become
as
unclear
,
as
devoid
of
any
life
,
as
an
old
photograph
.
But
in
the
last
six
months
his
father
's
image
had
begun
to
intrude
on
his
consciousness
at
odd
moments
,
in
the
middle
of
a
meeting
,
across
a
boardroom
table
,
in
a
gesture
,
the
droop
of
an
eyelid
,
the
tone
of
a
voice
,
the
line
of
a
speaker
's
mouth
,
the
shape
of
fingers
splayed
to
an
open
fire
.
His
father
's
ghost
had
returned
in
the
tangle
of
late-summer
foliage
,
the
first
fall
of
the
leaves
,
the
tentative
autumn
smells
.
He
wondered
if
the
same
thing
was
happening
to
Alice
.
For
all
their
mutual
sympathy
,
for
all
the
sense
he
had
of
their
being
irrevocably
bound
together
,
this
was
the
one
question
he
knew
he
would
never
ask
.
And
there
were
other
questions
,
one
question
in
particular
,
which
he
had
no
need
to
fear
from
her
.
She
was
n't
in
the
least
curious
about
his
sexual
life
.
He
knew
enough
psychology
to
have
at
least
some
insight
into
what
those
early
shaming
and
terrifying
experiences
had
done
to
her
.
Sometimes
he
thought
that
she
regarded
his
affairs
with
a
casual
,
slightly
amused
indulgence
as
if
,
herself
immune
to
a
childish
weakness
,
she
was
nevertheless
indisposed
to
criticize
it
in
others
.
Once
,
after
his
divorce
,
she
had
said
:
'l
find
it
extraordinary
that
a
straightforward
if
inelegant
device
for
ensuring
the
survival
of
the
species
should
involve
human
beings
in
such
emotional
turmoil
.
Does
sex
have
to
be
taken
so
seriously
?
"
And
now
he
found
himself
wondering
whether
she
knew
or
guessed
about
Amy
.
And
then
,
as
the
flaming
ball
rose
from
the
sea
,
the
gears
of
time
slipped
,
went
into
reverse
and
he
was
back
only
five
days
ago
lying
with
Amy
in
the
deep
hollow
of
the
dunes
,
smelling
again
the
scent
of
sand
and
grasses
and
the
salt
tang
of
the
sea
as
the
late
afternoon
warmth
drained
out
of
the
autumn
air
.
He
could
recall
every
sentence
,
every
gesture
,
the
timbre
of
her
voice
,
could
feel
again
the
hairs
rising
on
his
arms
at
her
touch
.
She
turned
towards
him
,
her
head
propped
on
her
hand
,
and
he
saw
the
strong
afternoon
light
shafting
with
gold
the
cropped
brightly
dyed
hair
.
Already
the
warmth
was
draining
from
the
air
and
he
knew
that
it
was
time
they
were
moving
.
But
lying
there
beside
her
,
listening
to
the
susurration
of
the
tide
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
through
a
haze
of
grasses
he
was
filled
,
not
with
post-coital
sadness
,
but
with
an
agreeable
languor
as
if
the
long-committed
Sunday
afternoon
still
stretched
ahead
of
them
.
It
was
Amy
who
said
:
"
Look
,
I
'd
better
be
getting
back
.
I
told
Neil

Oh

thinks

are
entitled

He
'd
like
to
ask
but
he
never
will
.
Sometimes
I
say
to
him
,
"
OK

off
now
to
fuck
my
lover

"
But
he
never
says
a

just
looks
miserable
because
he
does
n't
like
me
saying
"

Then
why
do

No

what
other
word
is
there

jumpy

come
back
unexpectedly

He
said
:
"

He
thinks
it
would
be
wrong
.
That
means
he
does
n't
really
want
to
.
If
men
want
to
they
usually
do
.
"
He
said
:
'That
has
been
my
experience
,
certainly
.
"
They
lay
side
by
side
like
effigies
,
both
staring
at
the
sky
.
She
seemed
content
not
to
talk
.
So
the
question
had
at
last
been
put
and
answered
.
It
had
been
with
shame
and
some
irritation
that
he
had
recognized
in
himself
for
the
first
time
the
nagging
of
jealousy
.
More
shaming
had
been
his
reluctance
to
put
it
to
the
test
.
And
there
were
those
other
questions
he
wanted
to
ask
but
dare
n't
.
"

"
With
his
wife
he
had
known
precisely
where
he
was
.
No
marriage
had
begun
with
a
more
definite
understanding
of
what
each
required
of
the
other
.
Their
unwritten
,
unspoken
,
only
half-acknowledged
pre-nuptial
agreement
had
needed
no
formal
ratification
.
He
would
earn
most
of
the
money
,
she
would
work
if
and
when
she
chose
.
She
had
never
been
particularly
enthusiastic
about
her
job
as
interior
designer
.
In
return
his
home
would
be
run
with
efficiency
and
reasonable
economy
.
They
would
take
separate
holidays
at
least
once
every
two
years
;
they
would
have
at
most
two
children
and
at
a
time
of
her
choosing
;
neither
would
publicly
humiliate
the
other
;
the
spectrum
of
marital
offences
under
this
heading
ranging
from
spoiling
the
other
's
dinner-party
stories
to
a
too-public
infidelity
.
It
had
been
a
success
.
They
had
liked
each
other
,
got
on
with
remarkably
little
rancour
and
he
had
been
genuinely
upset
,
if
principally
in
his
pride
,
when
she
had
left
him
.
Fortunately
marital
failure
had
been
mitigated
by
the
public
knowledge
of
her
lover
's
wealth
.
He
realized
that
to
a
materialistic
society
losing
a
wife
to
a
millionaire
hardly
counted
as
failure
.
In
their
friends
'
eyes
it
would
have
been
unreasonably
proprietorial
of
him
not
to
have
released
her
with
a
minimum
of
fuss
.
But
to
do
her
justice
,
Liz
had
loved
Gregory
,
would
have
followed
transformed
laughing
face
,
heard
her
ruefully
apologetic
voice
.
"
It
's
the
real
thing
this
time
,
darling
.
I
never
expected
it
and
I
can
still
hardly
believe
it
.
Try
not
to
feel
too
badly
,
it
is
n't
your
fault
.
There
's
nothing
to
be
done
.
"
The
real
thing
.
So
there
was
this
mysterious
real
thing
before
which
everything
went
down
,
obligations
,
habit
,
responsibility
,
duty
.
And
now
,
lying
in
the
dunes
,
seeing
the
sky
through
the
rigid
stalks
of
marram
grasses
,
he
thought
about
it
almost
with
terror
.
Surely
he
had
n't
found
it
at
last
and
with
a
girl
less
than
half
his
age
,
intelligent
but
uneducated
,
promiscuous
and
burdened
with
an
illegitimate
child
.
And
he
did
n't
deceive
himself
about
the
nature
of
her
hold
on
him
.
No
lovemaking
had
ever
been
as
erotic
or
as
liberating
as
their
half-illicit
couplings
on
unyielding
sand
within
yards
of
the
crashing
tide
.
Sometimes
he
would
find
himself
indulging
in
fantasy
,
would
picture
them
together
in
London
in
his
new
flat
.
The
flat
,
as
yet
unsought
,
no
more
than
a
vague
possibility
among
others
,
would
assume
dimensions
,
location
,
a
horribly
plausible
reality
in
which
he
found
himself
arranging
his
pictures
carefully
on
a
non-existent
wall
,
thinking
over
the
disposal
of
his
household
goods
,
the
exact
location
of
his
stereo
system
.
The
flat
overlooked
the
Thames
.
He
could
see
the
wide
windows
giving
a
view
over
the
river
as
far
as
Tower
Bridge
,
the
huge
bed
,
Amy
's
curved
body
striped
with
bands
of
sunlight
from
the
slatted
wooden
blinds
.
Then
the
sweet
,
deluding
pictures
would
dissolve
into
bleak
reality
.
There
was
the
child
.
She
would
want
the
child
with
her
.
Of
course
she
would
.
Anyway
,
who
else
could
look
after
it
?
He
could
see
the
indulgent
amusement
on
the
faces
of
his
friends
,
the
pleasure
of
his
enemies
,
the
child
lurching
,
sticky-fingered
,
about
the
flat
.
He
could
smell
in
imagination
what
Liz
had
never
let
him
know
in
actuality
-
the
smell
of
sour
milk
and
dirty
nappies
,
could
picture
the
dreadful
lack
of
peace
and
privacy
.
He
needed
these
realities
,
deliberately
emphasized
,
to
bring
him
back
to
sanity
.
He
was
horrified
that
even
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
seriously
have
contemplated
such
destructive
stupidity
.
He
thought
:
I
'm
obsessed
by
her
.
All
right
,
just
for
these
last
few
weeks
I
'll
enjoy
my
obsession
.
This
late
summer
would
be
brief
enough
,
the
warm
unseasonable
days
of
mellow
sunshine
could
n't
last
.
Already
the
evenings
were
darkening
.
Soon
he
would
smell
the
first
sour
tang
of
winter
on
the
sea
breezes
.
There
would
be
no
more
lying
in
the
warm
sand
dunes
.
She
could
n't
visit
Martyr
's
Cottage
again
,
that
would
be
recklessly
stupid
.
It
was
easy
to
convince
himself
that
with
care
,
when
Alice
was
in
London
and
no
visitors
expected
,
they
could
be
together
in
his
bedroom
perhaps
even
for
a
whole
night
,
but
he
knew
that
he
would
never
risk
it
.
Little
on
the
headland
was
private
for
long
.
This
was
his
St
Martin
's
summer
,
an
autumnal
madness
,
nothing
that
the
first
cold
of
winter
could
n't
wither
.
But
now
she
said
,
as
if
there
had
been
no
period
of
silence
between
them
,
"

He
put
out
his
hand
to
her
shoulder
,
warm
under
the
gritty
film
of
sand

mock
pomposity

"
And
then
she
turned
to
him
again
.
The
pattern
of
sand
on
her
shoulder
glistened
and
he
felt
her
mouth
moving
over
his
upper
lip
,
his
nipples
,
his
belly
.
And
then
she
knelt
over
him
and
the
round
childish
face
with
its
bush
of
bright
hair
shut
out
the
sky
.
Five
minutes
later
she
rolled
apart
from
him
and
began
shaking
the
sand
from
her
shirt
and
jeans
.
Tugging
the
jeans
over
her
thighs
,
she
said
:
"

"
The
question
-
or
was
it
a
demand
-
shocked
him
out
of
his
fantasy
as
crudely
as
if
,
unprovoked
,
she
had
suddenly
slapped
his
face
.
In
their
four
meetings
she
had
never
questioned
him
about
his
job
,
had
seldom
mentioned
the
power
station
except
,
as
on
this
afternoon
,
to
complain
half
seriously
that
it
spoilt
the
view
.
He
had
n't
made
a
deliberate
decision
to
keep
her
out
of
his
private
and
professional
life
.
When
they
were
together
that
life
hardly
entered
into
his
own
consciousness
.
The
man
who
lay
with
Amy
in
the
dunes
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
burdened
,
ambitious
,
calculating
scientist
who
ran
Larksoken
,
nothing
to
do
with
Alice
's
brother
,
with
Elizabeth
's
ex-husband
,
with
Hilary
's
ex-lover
.
Now
he
wondered
,
with
a
mixture
of
irritation
and
dismay
,
whether
she
had
deliberately
chosen
to
ignore
those
invisible
keep-out
signs
.
And
if
he
had
been
unconfiding
,
then
so
had
she
.
He
knew
little
more
about
her
now
than
when
they
had
first
encountered
each
other
in
the
abbey
ruins
on
a
blustery
August
evening
less
than
six
weeks
earlier
,
had
for
a
minute
stood
and
gazed
and
had
then
moved
silently
towards
each
other
in
a
wordless
,
amazed
recognition
.
Later
that
evening
she
had
told
him
that
she
came
from
Newcastle
,
that
her
widowed
father
had
remarried
and
that
she
and
her
stepmother
could
n't
get
on
.
She
had
moved
down
to
London
and
lived
in
squats
.
It
had
sounded
commonplace
enough
but
he
had
n't
quite
believed
it
and
nor
,
he
suspected
,
did
she
care
whether
or
not
he
did
.
Her
accent
was
more
Cockney
than
Geordie
.
He
had
never
asked
about
the
child
,
partly
from
a
kind
of
delicacy
but
mainly
because
he
preferred
not
to
think
of
her
as
a
mother
,
and
she
had
volunteered
no
information
about
Timmy
or
his
father
.
She
said
:
"
Well
,
why
do
n't
you
?
Like
I
said
,
you
're
the
boss
.
"
"
Not
over
my
staff
's
private
lives
.
If
Hilary
Robarts
thinks
she
has
been
libelled
and
seeks
redress
I
ca
n't
prevent
her
from
going
to
law
.
"
"
You
could
if
you
wanted
to
.
And
Neil
only
wrote
what
was
true
.
"
"
That
is
a
dangerous
defence
to
a
libel
action
.
Pascoe
would
be
ill
advised
to
rely
on
it
.
"
"
She
wo
n't
get
any
money
.
He
has
n't
got
any
.
And
if
he
has
to
pay
costs
it
will
ruin
him
.
"
"
He
should
have
thought
of
that
earlier
.
"
She
lay
back
with
a
little
thud
and
for
a
few
minutes
they
were
both
silent
.
Then
she
said
as
casually
as
if
the
previous
conversation
had
been
trivial
small
talk
which
was
already
half
forgotten
:
"
What
about
next
Sunday
?
I
could
get
away
late
afternoon
.
OK
by
you
?
"
So
she
bore
no
grudge
.
It
was
n't
important
to
her
,
or
if
it
was
,
she
had
decided
to
drop
it
,
at
least
for
now
.
And
he
could
put
from
him
the
treacherous
suspicion
that
their
first
meeting
had
been
contrived
,
part
of
a
plan
devised
by
her
and
Pascoe
to
exploit
his
influence
with
Hilary
.
But
that
,
surely
,
was
ridiculous
.
He
had
only
to
recall
the
inevitability
of
their
first
coming
together
,
her
passionate
,
uncomplicated
,
animal
gusto
in
their
lovemaking
to
know
that
the
thought
was
paranoid
.
He
would
be
here
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
It
might
be
their
last
time
together
.
Already
he
had
half
decided
that
it
had
to
be
.
He
would
free
himself
from
this
enslavement
,
sweet
as
it
was
,
as
he
had
freed
himself
from
Hilary
.
And
he
knew
,
with
a
regret
which
was
almost
as
strong
as
grief
,
that
with
this
parting
there
would
be
no
protests
,
no
appeals
,
no
desperate
clinging
to
the
past
.
Amy
would
accept
his
leaving
as
calmly
as
she
had
accepted
his
arrival
.
He
said
:
"
OK
.
About
four
thirty
then
.
Sunday
the
twenty-fifth
.
"
And
now
time
,
which
in
the
last
ten
minutes
seemed
mysteriously
to
have
halted
,
flowed
again
and
he
was
standing
at
his
bedroom
window
five
days
later
watching
the
great
ball
of
the
sun
rise
out
of
the
sea
to
stain
the
horizon
and
spread
over
the
eastern
sky
the
veins
and
arteries
of
the
new
day
.
Sunday
the
twenty-fifth
.
He
had
made
that
appointment
five
days
ago
and
it
was
one
that
he
would
keep
.
But
lying
there
in
the
dunes
he
had
n't
known
what
he
knew
now
,
that
he
had
another
and
very
different
appointment
to
keep
on
Sunday
,
September
the
twenty-fifth
.
Shortly
after
lunch
Meg
walked
across
the
headland
to
Martyr
's
Cottage
.
The
Copleys
had
gone
upstairs
to
take
their
afternoon
rest
and
for
a
moment
she
wondered
whether
to
tell
them
to
lock
their
bedroom
door
.
But
she
told
herself
that
the
precaution
was
surely
unnecessary
and
ridiculous
.
She
would
bolt
the
back
door
and
lock
the
front
door
after
her
as
she
left
and
she
would
n't
be
gone
for
long
.
And
they
were
perfectly
happy
to
be
left
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
old
age
reduced
anxiety
.
They
could
look
at
the
power
station
without
the
slightest
premonition
of
disaster
and
the
horror
of
the
Whistler
seemed
as
much
beyond
their
interest
as
it
was
their
comprehension
.
The
greatest
excitement
in
their
lives
,
which
had
to
be
planned
with
meticulous
care
and
some
anxiety
,
was
a
drive
into
Norwich
or
Ipswich
to
shop
.
It
was
a
beautiful
afternoon
,
warmer
than
most
in
the
past
disappointing
summer
.
There
was
a
gentle
breeze
and
from
time
to
time
Meg
paused
and
lifted
her
head
to
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
the
sweet-smelling
air
moving
against
her
cheeks
.
The
turf
was
springy
beneath
her
feet
and
to
the
south
the
abbey
stones
,
no
longer
mysterious
or
sinister
,
gleamed
golden
against
the
blue
untroubled
sea
.
She
did
not
need
to
ring
.
The
door
at
Martyr
's
Cottage
stood
open
as
it
often
did
in
sunny
weather
,
and
she
called
out
to
Alice
before
,
in
response
to
her
answering
voice
,
moving
down
the
corridor
to
the
kitchen
.
The
cottage
was
redolent
with
the
zesty
smell
of
lemon
overlaying
the
more
familiar
tang
of
polish
,
wine
and
wood
smoke
.
It
was
a
smell
so
keen
that
it
momentarily
brought
back
the
holiday
she
and
Martin
had
spent
in
Amalfi
,
the
trudge
hand-in-hand
up
the
winding
road
to
the
mountain-top
,
the
pile
of
lemons
and
oranges
by
the
roadside
,
putting
their
noses
to
those
golden
,
pitted
skins
,
the
laughter
and
the
happiness
.
The
image
experienced
in
a
flash
of
gold
,
a
flush
of
warmth
to
her
face
,
was
so
vivid
that
for
a
second
she
hesitated
at
the
kitchen
door
as
if
disorientated
.
Then
her
vision
cleared
and
she
saw
the
familiar
objects
,
the
Aga
and
the
gas
stove
with
the
nearby
working
surfaces
,
the
table
of
polished
oak
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
its
four
elegantly
crafted
chairs
,
and
at
the
far
end
Alice
's
office
with
the
walls
covered
with
bookshelves
and
her
desk
piled
with
proofs
.
Alice
was
standing
working
at
the
table
,
wearing
her
long
fawn
smock
.
She
said
:
"
As
you
can
see
,
I
'm
making
lemon
curd
.
Alex
and
I
enjoy
it
occasionally
and
I
enjoy
making
it
,
which
I
suppose
is
sufficient
justification
for
the
trouble
.
"
"
We
hardly
ever
had
it
-
Martin
and
I
,
that
is
.
I
do
n't
think
I
've
eaten
it
since
childhood
.
Mother
bought
it
occasionally
as
a
treat
for
Sunday
tea
.
"
"
If
she
bought
it
,
then
you
do
n't
know
what
it
ought
to
taste
like
.
"
Meg
laughed
and
settled
into
the
wicker
chair
to
the
left
of
the
fireplace
.
She
never
asked
if
she
could
help
in
the
kitchen
since
she
knew
Alice
would
be
irritated
by
an
offer
which
she
knew
to
be
impractical
and
insincere
.
Help
was
neither
needed
nor
welcomed
.
But
Meg
loved
to
sit
quietly
and
watch
.
Was
it
perhaps
a
memory
of
childhood
,
she
wondered
,
that
made
watching
a
woman
cooking
in
her
own
kitchen
so
extraordinarily
reassuring
and
satisfying
.
If
so
,
modern
children
were
being
deprived
of
yet
one
more
source
of
comfort
in
their
increasingly
disordered
and
frightening
world
.
She
said
:
"
Mother
did
n't
make
lemon
curd
but
she
did
enjoy
cooking
.
It
was
all
very
simple
,
though
.
"
"
That
's
the
difficult
kind
.
And
I
suppose
you
helped
her
.
I
can
picture
you
in
your
pinafore
making
gingerbread
men
.
"
"
She
used
to
give
me
a
piece
of
the
dough
when
she
was
making
pastry
.
By
the
time
I
'd
finished
pounding
it
,
rolling
it
and
shaping
it
,
it
was
dun-coloured
.
And
I
used
to
cut
out
shaped
biscuits
.
And
yes
,
I
did
make
gingerbread
men
with
currants
for
their
eyes
,
did
n't
you
?
