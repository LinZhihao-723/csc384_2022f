Detective
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
gazed
doubtfully
at
the
plate
before
him
.
Having
thought
he
was
hungry
,
he
now
realized
that
actually
he
needed
anything
rather
than
the
overflowing
plate
of
cholesterol
the
canteen
at
New
Scotland
Yard
had
provided
with
such
admirable
promptness
.
Sleep
would
perhaps
make
more
sense
after
thirty-six
hours
straight
on
duty
,
much
of
it
spent
with
a
sullen
Jamaican
who
had
killed
his
landlady
and
her
three
children
in
the
crowded
kitchen
of
a
house
behind
the
Westway
.
He
took
an
experimental
mouthful
of
fried
egg
and
waited
to
see
if
it
was
going
to
suit
him
,
then
progressed
to
the
baked
beans
,
cautiously
.
He
finished
the
egg
,
all
the
baked
beans
and
one
of
the
sausages
,
but
decided
the
fried
bread
was
tempting
fate
and
pushed
the
plate
aside
,
reaching
for
his
cup
of
tea
,
resting
both
elbows
on
the
table
.
He
lifted
a
hand
off
his
cup
in
weary
salute
to
one
of
his
sergeants.
a
very
dark
Scot
in
a
crumpled
grey
suit
who
was
walking
over
from
the
counter
,
and
the
man
altered
course
to
sit
opposite
him
.
"
How
goes
it
,
Bruce
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
had
accompanied
McLeish
from
his
last
posting
to
C1
,
that
division
of
New
Scotland
Yard
concerned
exclusively
with
murder
,
and
they
had
now
worked
together
for
four
years
in
the
CID
.
"
Got

Tottenham

off

've
finished
the
Westway

Ye
need
to
get
your
head
down
,
John
,
you
're
looking
rough
.
"
McLeish
nodded
.
He
had
glanced
in
the
washroom
mirror
and
it
had
not
been
a
reassuring
sight
.
A
big
man
,
six
foot
four
inches
in
his
socks
and
a
good
fourteen
stone
,
he
always
looked
mildly
untidy
,
and
this
morning
,
having
worn
the
same
clothes
for
a
day
and
a
half
he
looked
like
a
football
supporter
after
a
night
in
the
cells
.
At
thirty-two
,
he
was
young
enough
not
to
look
completely
haggard
,
even
after
thirty-six
hours
with
only
the
odd
hour
's
sleep
,
but
his
dark
hair
was
plastered
to
his
head
and
the
brown
eyes
were
sunk
back
in
his
head
and
reddened
with
smoke
and
exhaustion
.
"

I

Sergeant

.
"
Even
falling
asleep
as
he
was
,
McLeish
was
amused
at
Bruce
Davidson
's
hopeful
,
proprietorial
air
.
Catherine
Crane
had
joined
the
division
three
months
ago
,
creating
a
major
upheaval
.
She
was
a
slight
young
woman
of
twenty-seven
,
whose
dazzling
,
delicate
,
blond
looks
concealed
a
ferocious
intelligence
and
attack
.
Every
man
in
her
vicinity
had
found
himself
putting
his
best
foot
forward
,
and
she
had
done
wonders
for
the
sartorial
standards
of
the
notoriously
uncaring
C1
division
.
McLeish
himself
,
though
admiring
,
had
been
unaffected
;
he
had
been
in
love
for
over
a
year
with
a
young
woman
only
a
little
older
,
and
even
cleverer
,
than
Sergeant
Crane
.
His
Francesca
was
a
rising
star
in
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
,
and
they
planned
to
celebrate
her
thirtieth
birthday
with
a
skiing
holiday
,
due
to
start
in
two
weeks
'
time
.
He
smiled
on
Davidson
,
cheered
immeasurably
by
the
thought
of
getting
on
a
plane
with
Francesca
.
After
chatting
to
Davidson
for
a
few
minutes
longer
,
he
went
back
to
his
office
.
looking
for
his
secretary
,
a
plumpish
,
infinitely
competent
,
middle-aged
mother
of
three
.
She
was
on
the
phone
and
he
stood
silently
,
filling
the
doorway
,
raising
an
eyebrow
at
her
.
She
motioned
him
to
stay
.
"

he
said
,
brightening
,
and
she
watched
,
with
a
little
jealousy
.
as
he
hurried
back
to
his
desk
.
"

caff
in
ten
minutes
?
"
The
voice
at
the
other
end
was
slightly
husky
but
very
clear
.
"
It
's
Tristram

"

"
He
put
down
the
phone
,
rattled
.
With
his
much-loved
Francesca
came
her
four
younger
brothers
for
whom
,
as
the
eldest
child
of
a
widow
,
she
had
always
considered
herself
responsible
.
All
four
were
talented
musicians
and
difficult
people
,
in
varying
degrees
;
Tristram
.
one
of
the
twenty-four-year-old
twins
,
had
proved
the
most
difficult
,
perhaps
because
he
was
not
the
most
talented
.
McLeish
gritted
his
teeth
,
and
,
trying
not
to
consider
the
implications
of
what
he
had
been
told
.
made
one
quick
phone
call
,
then
took
the
lift
down
and
walked
across
the
road
from
New
Scotland
Yard
to
the
little
cafe
which
was
,
as
usual
,
full
of
workmen
engaged
in
rebuilding
the
offices
in
the
area
.
Stopping
to
buy
a
paper
,
he
caught
sight
of
Francesca
through
the
window
,
perched
on
one
of
the
bar
stools
,
totally
unconscious
of
the
table
full
of
men
next
to
her
all
eyeing
her
long
legs
.
He
stood
and
watched
her
,
putting
off
the
moment
when
.
as
he
half
knew
,
he
would
be
asked
to
acquiesce
in
some
lunatic
scheme
for
pulling
Tristram
out
of
trouble
,
and
saw
her
for
a
moment
from
a
position
of
detachment
:
a
tall
young
woman
looking
younger
than
her
twenty-nine
years
.
dark
,
with
a
long
straight
nose
and
arched
eyebrows
.
She
was
looking
particularly
uncompromising
today
,
tired
and
pale
,
her
dark
,
short
hair
spiking
up
at
the
back
.
She
had
been
crying
,
McLeish
observed
resignedly
,
as
he
pushed
through
the
door
.
"
All
right
,

me
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
sat
down
heavily
beside
her
,
and
got
a
careful
,
measuring
.
sidelong
look
.
"
I
have
to
go
to
New
York
in
a
hurry

Tristram

He
was
arrested
last
night
,
with
one
of
the
backing
group
and
three
of
the
band

They
're

She
sighed
so
heavily
that
her
whole
ribcage
moved
.
"
I
am
to
some
extent
on

she
said
,
reluctantly
and
not
looking
at
him
.
"
Mike

Michael
O'Brien

but
I

spot
.
"
McLeish
held
on
to
his
temper
,
reminding
himself
that
he
was
very
tired
.
Francesca
's
much
publicized
affair
with
Senator
Michael
O'Brien
was
the
reason
that
she
had
been
sent
home
rather
early
from
a
tour
of
duty
in
the
Embassy
in
Washington
,
over
a
year
previously
,
just
before
he
had
met
her
in
London
.
As
one
of
Francesca
's
DTI
colleagues
had
maliciously
observed
,
it
had
been
felt
that
fraternization
with
the
American
colleagues
could
be
carried
too
far
.
Francesca
herself
had
characteristically
taken
the
line
that
the
Foreign
Office
ought
to
have
been
glad
that
someone
on
the
staff
was
that
closely
involved
with
the
American
political
Establishment
.
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
with
O'Brien

"
"
Well

a
whole
year
.
There
'll
certainly
be
another
incumbent
by
now

But
he
is
the
senior
Senator
.
we
were
close
when
I
was
in
Washington
,

whichever
way
you

it
he

brother

buggered

up

a
New

jail

"
Her
classically
good
diction
always
became
even
clearer
under
stress
,
so
that
this
statement
emerged
with
the
slightly
metallic
clarity
of
a
dubbed
film
,
and
the
clientele
of
the
small
cafe
was
obviously
appreciating
every
moment
.
McLeish
decided
that
since
she
was
unaware
of
her
audience
it
did
not
become
him
to
be
selfconscious
,
and
asked
what
she
expected
even
a
Senator
to
achieve
in
these
circumstances
?
"

McLeish
found
himself
on
the
verge
of
suggesting
that
a
thoroughly
unpleasant
time
in
a
New

jail
might
succeed
in
curing
Tristram

all
other
methods

exhortation

family
support

from

sobered

She
slid
obediently
off
the
bar

,
bidding
a
civil
good-morning

the
cafe
owner

observed

have
swept
her

embrace

they
walked
together

himself

"
The
look
she
flicked
him
reminded
him
that
this
was
one
area
where
she
would
not
appeal
for
his
help
;
she
had
been
more
than
careful
to
protect
him
from
any
involvement
with
a
drug-taking
brother
.
It
was
one
of
her
many
advantages
that
as
a
professional
civil
servant
herself
she
understood
the
constraints
of
his
career
.
She
turned
to
go
,
head
down
.
McLeish
saw
that
she
was
crying
again
,
but
decided
coldly
there
was
nothing
he
was
going
to
do
and
trudged
wearily
back
to
the
lift
,
the
morning
's
cheerfulness
totally
evaporated

The

,
like
everything
else
in
the
glass-walled
hall
,
was
immaculately
clean
,
glossy
,
highly
fashionable
and
faintly
reminiscent
of
an
Italian
restaurant
.
The
young
woman
in
the
plain
suit
was
not
intimidated
by
it
,

by
the
hand-carved

that
proclaimed
her
to
be

The
immaculate

fraying
a
little
,
discomfort
with
the
situation
showing
like
the
edge
of
a
petticoat
.
She
looked
across
the
hall

visibly
relaxed

she
saw
a
man
moving
swiftly
down
the
staircase

The
man
altered
course
impatiently
to
deal
with
the
interruption
;
just
under
six
foot
,
he
looked
smaller
because
of
the
width
of
the
powerful
sloping
shoulders
which
even
good
tailoring
could
do
little
to
minimize

looked
sharply
at
the

energy
in
his
every

the
patchy
make-up

broken
veins

showing

Penelope
Huntley
,
who
would
very
much
have
liked
to
have
gone
on
with
the
discussion
,
found
herself
swept
out
of
the
office
,
and
walked
slowly
down
the
road
,
flushed
with
a
mixture
of
disappointment
and
excitement
.
In
New
Scotland
Yard
John
McLeish
was
trying
,
increasingly
irritably
,
to
clear
his
desk
so
he
could
go
home
.
Bruce
Davidson
was
making
a
meal
of
explaining
a
straightforward
case
essentially
because
he
was
trying
to
impress
Catherine
Crane
.
Not
that
he
was
succeeding
;
Sergeant
Crane
was
sitting
,
legs
crossed
,
only
just
not
fidgeting
,
as
Bruce
Davidson
wore
on
through
a
lot
of
unnecessary
detail
.
It
was
unprecedented
for
any
woman
to
have
that
effect
on
Davidson
,
whose
success
in
this
field
was
legendary
.
She
was
,
of
course
,
very
desirable
,
McLeish
conceded
:
reddish-blond
hair
above
blue
eyes
,
and
a
perfect
,
pale
skin
,
lightly
freckled
.
Her
apple-green
light
wool
suit
reminded
them
all
that
spring
would
one
day
come
.
Indeed
,
she
was
a
true
beauty
:
straight
,
fine
features
,
a
long
neck
,
a
gently
curved
,
slim
figure
.
He
found
himself
smiling
gently
as
he
sat
and
watched
her
,
and
pulled
himself
up
sharply
,
realizing
that
the
girl
was
annoyed
by
what
was
obviously
a
familiar
reaction
.
He
had
looked
at
her
papers
three
months
ago
,
when
the
posting
had
been
announced
,
and
had
noted
how
well
educated
she
was
.
She
had
joined
the
Met
with
three
A
levels
and
a
huge
number
of
O
levels
as
an
eighteen-year-old
,
then
worked
her
way
over
into
the
CID
,
and
was
now
a
Detective
Sergeant
and
ready
to
move
up
,
having
passed
the
exams
for
Inspector
.
His
phone
rang
and
he
picked
it
up
,
reluctantly
.
"

Catherine

in

carry
on

conversation

while
Davidson
was
finding
her
some
more
coffee
,
Catherine
turned
the
photograph
on
John
McLeish

desk
to
look
at
it

eleven

He
stopped
,
uncharacteristically
gravelled
,
got
a
quick
entirely
comradely
look
of
amusement
,
and
laughed
.
"
Come

"
John
McLeish
,
seated
at
the
other
side
of
a
table
from
Commander
Stevenson
,
would
have
agreed
with
this
judgement
.
Despite
the
urgency
of
the
summons
,
he
had
been
kept
waiting
in
Stevenson
's
outer
office
long
enough
to
read
the
early
edition
of
the
Evening
Standard
.
On
page
four
,
as
he
had
feared
,
was
a
bad
picture
of
Tristram
under
the
headline
"
Singing
star
on
US
Drugs
Charge
"
.
He
skimmed
the
accompanying
text
,
which
added
little
to
what
Francesca
had
already
told
him
,
filling
up
the
two
columns
with
a
recital
of
Tristram
's
career
beginning
with
his
legendary
recording
of
"
Panis
Angelicus
"
as
a
thirteen-year-old
treble
at
St
Joe
's
.
As
usual
,
much
was
made
of
the
fact
that
he
was
younger
brother
to
the
wildly
successful
Peregrine
,
now
in
Japan
on
tour
with
his
group
.
Indeed
McLeish
reflected
,
that
encapsulated
the
trouble
with
Tristram
-
everything
that
he
could
do
,
Perry
,
two
years
his
senior
,
could
apparently
do
just
that
bit
better

Stevenson
sounded

added
sourly

McLeish
gazed
at
his
superior

Most
missing
person
reports
do
not
end
in
a
murder
.
Typically
they
are
husbands

wives
walking
out
to
live
somewhere
else
,

teenagers
leaving
home

He
kept
what
he
hoped
was
a
bright
and
intelligent
expression
on
his
face

waited
for
enlightenment

Stevenson

Sir

McLeish
knew
what
Treasury
Questions
were
,
thanks
to
Francesca
.
Every
afternoon
in
the
House
of
Commons
MPs
could
raise
questions
with
Ministers
about
their
Departments
.
These
had
to
be
answered
,
and
answered
well
-
or
at
least
the
first
ten
or
so
did
-
because
the
original
questioner
and
other
MPs
were
allowed
to
ask
supplementary
questions
.
Once
you
got
down
to
Question
11
,
the
questioner
would
get
a
deeply
unhelpful
written
response
which
would
,
if
the
civil
servants
knew
their
business
,
leave
no
one
any
the
wiser
.
Endearingly
,
Francesca
herself
was
not
good
at
drafting
that
sort
of
answer
and
usually
had
to
enlist
a
more
senior
colleague
to
achieve
the
correct
polished
hand-off
.
And
he
knew
that
the
Financial
Secretary
was
the
junior
of
three
Treasury
Ministers
and
did
not
sit
in
the
Cabinet

looked

"
The
Private
Secretary
-
Michael
Marsden
,
he
remembered
with
an
effort
-
signalled
them
from
the
door
and
McLeish
moved
forward
,
keen
to
see
what
the
kingpin
of
this
row
of
skittles
looked
like
.
His
first
thought
,
as
he
shook
the
hand
of
the
distinctive
dark
man
almost
as
tall
as
himself
,
was
that
Francesca
must
have
got
it
wrong
this
time
.
Giles
Hawick
was
not
the
sort
of
man
you
could
flatten
easily
,
and
if
you
managed
it
,
he
would
not
pop
up
,
bright
,
smiling
and
bearing
no
grudge
,
to
face
you
the
next
ti
me
.
If
you
injured
this
one
,
it
would
be
as
well
to
kill
him
before
he
killed
you
.
McLeish
stepped
back
,
surprised
at
the
force
of
his
reaction
,
and
introduced
Catherine
Crane
,
watching
Giles
Hawick
carefully
.
The
high
,
arched
eyebrows
in
the
long
bony
face
rose
slightly
in
surprise
,
but
no
more
.
The
immediate
impression
of
directed
dominance
did
not
come
from
the
man
's
physique
,
impressive
though
that
was
,
McLeish
decided
as
he
accepted
the
offered
chair
and
placed
Catherine
at
the
side
of
the
room
.
Giles
Hawick
was
a
beautifully
put
together
man
,
something
over
six
foot
without
a
spare
ounce
of
flesh
anywhere
,
the
long
lines
in
the
face
being
particularly
strong
.
Nor
were
the
very
deep-set
dark
brown
eyes
particularly
hypnotic
,
as
journalists
occasionally
suggested
.
It
was
the
controlled
,
economical
force
that
emanated
from
the
man
that
was
impressive
,
and
the
speed
with
which
he
absorbed
information
.
In
about
two
minutes
he
had
established
precisely
which
members
of
C1
he
was
dealing
with
and
why
.
John
McLeish
,
himself
a
forceful
character
,
felt
as
if
he
had
been
put
through
a
wringer
.
He
waited
,
out
of
long
experience
with
dominant
characters
,
until
a
natural
break
occurred
and
used
it
to
ask
for
some
background
,
starting
with
how
long
the
Minister
had
known
Miss
Morgan
.
Giles
Hawick
,
looking
surprised
,
sat
more
easily
in
his
chair
and
started
to
marshal
his
thoughts
.
"
I
've
known
her
a
couple
of
years
.
We
met
when
she
came
with
the
chairman
of
one
of
the
big
contractors
to
lobby
me
about
increasing
the
road-building
programme
,
when
I
was
a
spokesman
for
Transport
.
She
was
working
for
Yeo
Davis
,
where
she
is
a
partner
now
.
A
case
of
gamekeeper
turned
poacher
,
given
that
she
had
been
a
fast-stream
entrant
to
the
Treasury
,
much
of
whose
function
it
is
to
resist
that
sort
of
demand
.
"
Francesca
might
have
it
right
after
all
,
McLeish
thought
,
enjoying
the
turn
of
phrase
.
"
I
liked
the
look
of
Angela
,
and
organized
an
introduction
through
a
mutual
acquaintance
.
"
Not
being
prepared
to
be
beholden
to
those
who
were
lobbying
you
,
McLeish
observed
,
considering
the
formidable
professional
across
the
table
.
"
My
first
wife
died
some
years
ago
,
as
you
may
know
.
At
the
time
I
met
her
,
Angela
told
me
that
she
was
involved
with
someone
else
.
Women
make
their
own
minds
up
about
what
they
want
to
do
,
I
find
,
so
I
left
it
;
but
about
a
year
ago
she
invited
me
to
a
party
and
indicated
that
whoever
it
had
been
was
no
longer
around
.
I
was
very
pleased
,
and
we
,
well
,
we
wasted
no
time
.
We
intend
to
marry
in
April
,
immediately
after
the
House
rises
.
"
He
stopped
and
stared
out
of
the
window
,
across
Horse
Guards
'
,
looking
suddenly
weary
.
"
Have
you
talked
to
her
family
?
"
"
Not
yet
,
sir
.
"
"
They
are
very
distressed
.
There
are
only
two
children
,
both
daughters
.
Angela
is
the
younger
.
"
"
Is
there
much
difference
in
age
?
"
"
Four
years
.
Jennifer
has
not
married
yet
.
She
's
a
very
attractive
girl
.
In
fact
I
took
her
out
a
couple
of
times
myself
when
I
found
that
Angela
was
occupied
with
someone
else
.
I
get
on
well
with
them
all
,
actually
.
I
think
Francis
Morgan
feels
I
'm
a
bit
old
for
Angela
-
I
'm
forty-three
and
she
is
twenty-nine
-
but
he
's
never
brought
himself
to
say
so
.
And
Sarah
Morgan
likes
the
idea
of
Angela
marrying
someone
in
the
government
.
"
McLeish
considered
this
cold
and
rational
assessment
.
"
When
did
you
last
see
her
?
Miss
Angela
Morgan
,
I
mean
.
"
"
Early
on
Saturday
morning
-
about
eight-thirty
.
I
did
n't
expect
to
see
her
again
until
late
on
Monday
-
I
went
off
to
do
some
walking
for
the
weekend
and
was
taking
an
extra
day
.
I
rang
her
on
Monday
night
and
got
no
answer
,
but
that
did
n't
worry
me
.
I
was
having
lunch
with
her
on
Tuesday
.
She
did
n't
turn
up
,
so
of
course
I
then
telephoned
her
office
and
found
she
had
n't
been
there
that
week
.
I
rang
her
parents
yesterday
-
Wednesday
.
I
had
n't
wanted
to
worry
them
before
.
Today
I
felt
I
could
leave
things
no
longer
,
so
I
had
a
word
with
a
colleague
in
the
Home
Office
.
Perhaps
I
should
have
done
it
before
,
but
I
suppose
one
's
always
afraid
of
making
a
fool
of
oneself
.
"
McLeish
decided
it
was
unlikely
that
that
sort
of
consideration
very
much
exercised
this
cool
customer
.
"
You
had
no
idea
where
she
might
be

would
not

not
imagine
what
has
happened
.

has
usually
happened

people
vanish

"
McLeish
took
a
minute
to
formulate
his
reply
,
and
Giles
Hawick
got
it
at
once
.
"

Giles
Hawick
looked
down
at
his
blotter
,
lips
tight
with
tension
.
"
Angela

McLeish
decided
there
was
no
point
tempering
the
wind
to
this
competent
and
well-clad
lamb
.
"
We
'll
also
circulate

"
Giles
Hawick
suddenly
looked
tired
and
McLeish
felt
for
him
,
as
he
promised
to
keep
him
in
touch
with
their
investigations
.
Not
much
danger
of
his
Commander
letting
him
slip
up
on
that
,
he
thought
drily
.
They
rose
to
go
,
Giles
Hawick
with
the
politician
's
automatic
competence
escorting
them
to
the
lift
and
warmly
asking
Catherine
Crane
where
she
had
trained
and
how
she
liked
her
job
.
He
showed
them
into
the
lift
,
shaking
hands
with
them
both
,
and
as
Catherine
turned
away
from
him
to
press
the
lift
button
,
he
suddenly
raised
his
eyebrows
at
McLeish
in
amusement
at
his
own
response
to
her
.
"
In
what
circumstances
would
an
attractive
woman
of
twenty-nine
walk
out
on
a
fiance
without
telling
him
or
anyone
else
where
she
was
going
?
"
McLeish
asked
Catherine
as
they
walked
back
through
St
James
's
Park
.
"
If
she
was
frightened
of
him
?
"
She
sounded
doubtful
,
but
McLeish
decided
it
would
be
possible
to
be
frightened
of
Giles
Hawick
.
He
had
the
look
of
a
man
with
a
nasty
temper
if
you
got
on
his
wrong
side
.
"
But
presumably
the
Commander
does
n't
think
she
ran
away
?
I
mean
Special
Branch
has
asked
us
to
come
in
.
They
all
think
something
's
happened
to
her
,
do
n't
they
?
"
She
might
sound
diffident
,
McLeish
thought
,
amused
,
but
she
was
n't
,
just
more
careful
than
his
blunt
Francesca
about
how
she
made
her
points
.
"
I
agree
.
I
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
it
at
all
.
The
best
we
could
hope
for
is
that
she
's
had
a
brainstorm
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
often
that
happens
outside
of
books
.
Anyway
,
we
need
to
get
back
and
get
the
procedures
into
place
.
"
All
that
took
some
five
hours
for
very
little
result
.
By
ten
p.m
.
McLeish
was
reasonably
satisfied
that
Angela
Morgan
was
not
lying
unidentified
in
any
morgue
,
nor
in
any
hospital
,
unconscious
or
suffering
from
loss
of
memory
.
Tomorrow
he
would
have
to
talk
to
her
family
and
last
known
associates
.
Remembering
that
he
had
sent
Catherine
Crane
to
see
Angela
Morgan
's
employers
,
he
decided
to
find
out
how
she
had
got
on
;
late
as
it
was
he
did
not
think
she
would
have
gone
off
duty
without
reporting
to
him
.
He
got
half-way
down
the
corridor
and
realized
in
irritation
that
he
had
no
idea
where
she
had
been
given
an
office
.
That
small
problem
solved
itself
readily
:
one
door
stood
open
with
Bruce
Davidson
leaning
on
the
side
in
a
careful
presentation
of
a
man
who
had
just
happened
to
be
passing
.
He
stood
aside
for
McLeish
,
then
took
himself
off
,
observing
unnecessarily
that
he
just
had
a
wee
bit
paperwork
to
finish
up
.
Catherine
Crane
,
installed
behind
her
desk
,
gave
him
a
slightly
weary
smile
.
She
looked
,
McLeish
observed
,
as
immaculate
as
she
had
in
the
morning
,
but
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
looked
huge
.

That
Wednesday
she
had
lunch
with
one
F.
Wilson
,
DTI
.
That
's
one
person
I
know
where
to
find
.
"

Who
is
it
?
"
"
A
girl
called
Francesca
Wilson
,
who
is
doing
work
that
involves
rescuing
dud
companies
which
employ
a
lot
of
people
in
difficult
areas
.
"
He
hesitated
,
not
sure
why
he
was
being
cautious
.
"
In
fact
,
she
's
my
girlfriend
.
"
Catherine
Crane
smiled
at
him
gently
.
"
Well
,
that
is
easy
enough
for
you
,
is
n't
it
?
Are
you
seeing
her
tonight
?
"
McLeish
scowled
,
reminded
.
"
No
,
she
's
in
New
York
.
"
He
glanced
sideways
at
Catherine
Crane
's
unchanged
expression
which
showed
merely
courteous
interest
,
and
decided
to
sit
down
and
talk
.
"
Francesca
's
got
four
brothers
,
see
,
two
of
them
professional
singers
,
two
of
them
by
the
grace
of
God
ordinary
working
stiffs
in
respectable
offices
.
"
He
paused
,
trying
to
decide
how
to
go
on
,
noticing
how
dirty
the
walls
of
the
small
,
dark
office
looked
against
Catherine
Crane
's
neat
,
pale
suit
and
bright
blond
hair
.
"
Is
one
of
them
Perry
Wilson
?
"
she
enquired
,
visibly
impressed
.
"
Yes
.
He
's
OK
.
Well
,
he
's
not
,
but
he
's
not
causing
any
difficulty
just
at
the
moment
.
There
are
twins
at
the
bottom
of
the
family
and
it
's
Tristram
who
's
in
trouble
.
Done
for
possession
of
Class
A
drugs
in
New
York
.
"
"
That
is
difficult
.
"
"
And
Francesca
's
there
to
try
and
get
him
out
on
bail
.
"
"
Does
n't
he
have
a
lawyer
?
"
"
Good
question
.
Fran
's
gone
to
make
sure
no
one
lays
a
finger
on
a
brother
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
They
're
like
that
.
"
He
brooded
for
a
moment
,
sighed
,
and
reached
for
the
list
again
.
"
I
'll
be
able
to
talk
to
her
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
sounds
as
if
she
might
actually
be
useful
.
She
'll
at
least
be
able
to
explain
Yeo
Davis
to
us
.
Anything
else
on
Miss
Morgan
?
"
Catherine
Crane
moved
one
tidy
package
of
paper
,
neatly
tabulated
,
in
search
of
an
equally
tidy
pile
,
and
McLeish
watched
with
pleasure
.
Keeping
the
paperwork
straight
might
not
be
glamorous
but
it
was
eighty
per
cent
of
the
battle
as
he
well
knew
,
and
he
made
certain
his
staff
did
too
.
It
did
n't
look
as
if
that
particular
conversation
was
going
to
be
necessary
in
this
case
.
"
Sorry
,
here
we
are
.
Mr
Yeo
sent
us
her
CV
-
the
one
they
send
out
to
prospective
clients
.
Only
the
basic
facts
,
but
useful
.
And
some
spare
copies
of
the
photographs
that
came
out
from
the
DTI
this
afternoon
-
we
ran
off
dozens
to
send
out
to
the
regional
forces
,
but
I
snaffled
six
.
"
McLeish
took
the
photographs
and
considered
them
.
A
lively
,
arrogant
face
,
rather
square
,
eyes
wide-set
,
and
a
full
,
curving
mouth
.
Dark
brown
hair
,
dark
brown
eyes
,
and
slightly
sallow
skin
which
the
photographer
had
not
bothered
to
disguise
or
retouch
,
having
understood
that
this
was
part
of
her
charm
.
Not
a
true
beauty
,
but
the
girl
beckoned
you
off
the
paper
;
confident
,
sexy
,
that
face
invited
you
to
join
in
if
you
could
stand
the
pace
.
A
handful
,
McLeish
thought
,
but
a
lot
of
fun
.
He
reached
for
the
CV
while
Catherine
Crane
busied
herself
systematically
with
her
papers
.
Same
age
as
Francesca
,
and
had
attended
the
same
good
North
London
all-girls
'
grammar
school
,
for
entry
to
which
aspiring
parents
would
have
been
prepared
to
pay
blood-money
had
there
been
anyone
in
the
austere
intellectual
governing
body
and
teaching
staff
who
would
have
taken
it
.
They
must
have
been
the
same
year
,
for
their
birthdays
were
only
two
months
apart
.
Even
among
perhaps
a
hundred
girls
in
their
year
,
they
must
have
known
each
other
quite
well
.
Their
ways
had
diverged
at
university
-
Angela
Morgan
had
gone
on
to
Oxford
to
read
English
,
the
fatherless
Francesca
,
under
more
pressure
to
make
a
living
,
had
gone
to
Cambridge
to
read
law
.
A
clever
girl
,
though
,
Miss
Morgan
,
an
Exhibitioner
like
Francesca
and
a
respectable
second-class
degree
.
He
considered
the
arrogant
,
attractive
,
knowing
face
again
and
put
the
photo
down
,
shifting
his
attention
to
Catherine
's
pale
,
classic
beauty
.
He
was
about
to
divide
up
responsibility
for
checking
Angela
Morgan
's
last
recorded
movements
when
Bruce
Davidson
knocked
and
put
his
head
in
.
"
John

It
's
Francesca
,
on
the
phone
from
New
York
,
says
will
you
hurry
.
"
McLeish
jogged
down
the
passage
,
overcoming
irritation
.
Of
course
he
had
the
sense
to
hurry
when
she
was
hanging
on
a
line
from
New
York
.
"
Talk
more
slowly
,
"
he
said
,
in
exasperation
,
after
the
first
few
seconds
.
She
was
sounding
strained
,
and
as
always
when
she
was
over-extended
she
was
being
unnecessarily
bossy
.
Her
sigh
of
exasperation
reached
him
from
3,000
miles
away
.
"
Sorry
,
but
I
've
been
at
it
all
day

"
"
Well
,
calm
down
.
I
need
to
talk
to
you
,
too
.
"
"
What
about
?
"
Francesca
sounded
rattled
and
hostile
,
and
McLeish
gazed
at
the
wall
,
wondering
if
he
had
really
been
in
love
with
her
for
over
a
year
.
"
About
someone
called
Angela
Morgan
whom
you
or
another
F.
Wilson
at
the
DTI

lunch
with
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
.
She
's
been
reported
missing
and
we
're
checking
her
movements
for
the
two
weeks
before
she
vanished
.
"
A
dead
silence
ensued
and
he
shook
the
phone
.

Francesca

"
Well
,
at
least
Francesca
's
mind
appeared
to
be
functioning
on
a
subject
unconnected
with
her
damned
brothers
,
McLeish
thought
grimly

at
the

There
was
a
pause
while
she
gathered

patiently

John
McLeish
blinked
at
the
telephone

Francesca
's
judgement
was
typically
over-judicial
and
conscientiously
unemotional
,
but
this
had
real
force
behind
it
.
He
had
never
heard
Francesca
giving
vent
to
feminine
jealousy
and
on
the
whole
he
found
the
experience
refreshing

advantage

his

grimly

that

asked
directly

might
not

the
truth
all

made
it
sound
like
someone
who
came
to
clean
the
telephone

what

call
themselves

I
think
they
use
some
phrase
like
"
government

They
help
clients
to
push
the
right
buttons
in

in
the
UK

and
increasingly
,

perfectly

conscientiously

than
wittering
on
for
hours
about
relationships

opinion-formers
.
Angela
got
up
my
nose
as
usual
on
this
point
over
lunch
,
banging
on
about
the
importance
of
seeing
that
Ministers
were
properly
informed
and
by
the
right
people

the
Civil
Service
spent
all
its
time
obfuscating
issues

wrong
people

McLeish
decided
that
it
was
probably
not
the
moment
to
suggest
to
her
that
the
real
reason
any
civil
servant
disliked
lobbyists
must
be
that
the
chaps
were
paid

got
a
view
other
than
the
Departmental
one

now

an
important
contact

a
senior
opinion-former

so
she
flatteringly
told
me
.
It
was
quite
a
good
example
of
lobbying
,
in
fact
.
It
's
widely
known
-
because
the
unions
have
publicized
it

that
the
Department
is
looking
at
bailing
out
Huerter
Textiles

Henry

her
points

irritably

her
firm

Huerter

"
"
No

no

quite
the
contrary

Her
firm

Yeo

working
for
Barton
Mills
,
which
is
the
other
really
big
surviving
textile
company
in
the
north-west
.
Their
chief
executive
,
Andy
Barton
,
feels
,
with
some
reason
one
would
have
to
say
,
that
it
is
n't
right
that
the
government
should
bail
out
a
competitor
.
The
point
is
,
darling
,
that
in
order
to
make
sure
Huerter
has
a
future
,
we
would
have
to
put
a
lot
of
money
in
to
restore
a
bombed-out
balance
sheet
.
Barton
has
heavy
borrowings
too
,

to
put
it
crudely
,
if
they
're
paying
interest
and
Huerter
is
n't
,
Huerter
ought
to
be
able

undercut
them
in
the
market

it

an
offensively
elementary
consideration

one

which
Ministers

had
been
drawn
.
Yeo
Davis
seem
to
have
felt
,

it
was
worth
a
lunch

She
paused
.
"
I
'd
have
to
say
that

the
change
of

they
ought
to
have
a
very
good
chance
of
preventing
us

this
lot
did
come
in

and
not
be
rescued
,
and
face
up
to
competition
,
and
all
that
.
But
whatever
they
said
,
as
you
know
they
have
n't
actually
done
any
of
it
yet
-
they
did
rescue
Fryers
and
Towyn
Metals
,
using
tax-payers
'
money
,
just
like
they
said
they
would
n't
.
Yeo
Davis
could
have
credibly
warned
Barton
that
,
whatever
the
public
statements
,
there
was
a
real
risk
that
Huerter
would
be
bailed
out
.
"
McLeish
considered
this
,
"
Are
lobbyists
well
paid
?
"
"
Yes
.
Not
that
Angela
needed
the
money

"
"
Rich
girl

is
she
?
"
"
Very
.
She
did
n't
earn
it
in
any
conventional
sense
:
her
last
employer
left
one
third
of
his
substantial
fortune
to
her
outright
,
and
another
third
for
life
.
His
family
-
a
sister
and
niece
as
I
remember
-
was
awfully
cross
.
This
was
about
two
years
ago
.
"
McLeish
told
Francesca
to
hang
on
while
he
got
this
down
as
a
note
,
and
stared
at
the
result
.
It
made
a
good
reason
for
those
excluded
to
dislike
Miss
Morgan
,
but
it
had
been
true
any
time
these
past
two
years
.
"
When
you
had
lunch
,
how
was
she
?
I
mean
,
it
did
n't
sound
as
if
she
had
plans
to
go
off
with
someone
else
.
"
In
the
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
he
heard
Francesca
think
.
"
No
,
she
did
n't
come
over
like
that
,
not
at
all
.
In
fact
,
she
was
excited
in
an
innocent
way
about
the
wedding
plans
.
Reception
at
the
House
,
all
very
grand
and
smart
.
And
awfully
good
for
her
business
,
too
.
"
McLeish
smiled
to
himself
at
the
swift
fall
from
grace
in
the
postscript
.
Prodding
gently
,
he
got
Francesca
to
run
through
the
substance
of
the
lunch-time
conversation
.
It
was
clear
that
Miss
Morgan
's
brain
had
been
fully
engaged
on
what
she
was
doing
,
which
was
pushing
a
client
's
interest
,
and
that
such
attention
as
she
could
spare
from
that
had
been
centred
on
her
forthcoming
marriage
.
Nothing
at
all
there
,
five
days
before
her
disappearance
,
to
suggest
she
was
planning
to
vanish
.
Francesca
's
attention
would
have
been
undivided
as
well
,
as
that
lunch
had
taken
place
before
Tristram
had
managed
to
get
himself
so
comprehensively
into
trouble
.
McLeish
remembered
abruptly
Francesca
's
chief
preoccupation
.
"
How
are
you
getting
on
over
there
?
"
he
asked
,
cautiously
.
"
Much
fixing
is
going
on
.
I
'm
basically
just
biting
my
fingernails
and
holding
Tristram
together
.
He
has
been
bailed
on
several
sureties
and
appears
in
court
tomorrow
.
"
She
was
sounding
terse
and
McLeish
decided
not
to
ask
her
any
more
details
over
the
transatlantic
phone
.
"
I
've
told
them
here
I
do
n't
need
the
week
after
next
off
,
"
he
said
,
as
levelly
as
he
could
.
"
Oh
,
John
.
"
She
sounded
appalled
.
"
I
'd
managed
to
hang
on
to
it
.
Why
ever
did
you
do
that
?
"
"
How
was
I
supposed
to
know
?
"
he
said
,
instantly
aware
that
he
had
acted
too
hastily
because
he
had
been
so
angry
with
her
.
"
Well
,
I
said
I
'd
call
you
.
I
ought
to
be
home
in
three
days
and
I
've
made
a
deal
with
Henry
.
That
was
just
plain
bloody-minded
of
you
.
"
"
Coming
from
you
,
that
's
ridiculous
!
"
A
combination
of
justified
annoyance
,
guilt
and
weeks
of
overwork
blew
John
McLeish
's
temper
to
shreds
instantly
,
and
Francesca
,
seriously
over-stressed
and
not
one
to
duck
a
quarrel
at
the
best
of
times
,
responded
in
kind
.
She
banged
the
phone
down
a
second
before
he
did
,
leaving
him
raging
.
Ten
minutes
later
he
had
calmed
down
sufficiently
to
make
himself
a
cup
of
coffee
and
write
himself
a
note
to
check
Angela
Morgan
's
financial
status
.
He
bethought
himself
guiltily
of
Sergeant
Crane
,
who
might
be
assumed
to
be
waiting
to
continue
the
conversation
that
Francesca
's
call
had
interrupted
,
and
padded
down
the
corridor
.
Her
office
was
now
marked
by
a
frieze
of
officers
,
two
lounging
half
in
and
half
out
of
her
door
,
a
third
a
little
behind
,
the
attention
of
all
three
directed
entirely
towards
her
desk
.
Two
of
the
three
moved
off
as
he
arrived
,
with
unconvincing
references
to
waiting
papers
,
but
Bruce
Davidson
stood
his
ground
,
enquiring
heartily
how
Francesca
was
and
had
she
been
helpful
?
McLeish
considered
him
with
something
between
amusement
and
irritation
.
Bruce
was
pale
with
the
deep
pallor
that
overworked
CID
tend
to
acquire
in
London
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
seriously
overtired
and
overweight
.
But
he
was
alert
and
sparkling
,
his
motor
well
and
truly
turned
on
by
the
presence
of
Catherine
Crane
,
and
he
probably
was
n't
going
to
go
home
till
he
,
or
Catherine
,
dropped
in
their
tracks
.
"
She
was
fine
,
and
yes
she
was
,
"
he
said
,
dealing
with
Bruce
's
formal
question
.
"
And
it
'll
all
wait
till
the
morning
.
Go
home
,
Bruce
,
or
back
to
whatever
your
case
is
,
and
I
'll
have
a
word
with
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
He
nodded
decisively
,
and
equally
firmly
walked
into
her
office
and
closed
the
door
on
Davidson
's
hopeful
face
.
"
Sorry
,
but
that
phone
call
was
useful
.
"
He
ran
,
as
dispassionately
as
he
could
,
through
Francesca
's
account
of
her
lunch
with
Angela
Morgan
.
"
So
she
probably
did
n't
vanish
voluntarily
,
"
Catherine
Crane
said
,
in
summary
.
"
It
does
n't
sound
like
it
.
"
He
looked
unseeingly
at
the
beautiful
face
across
the
table
,
hearing
the
echo
of
his
quarrel
with
Francesca
,
feeling
his
mind
still
chuntering
on
in
justification
of
the
anger
that
had
led
him
to
cut
off
all
possibility
of
their
holiday
next
week
.
Well
,
he
had
been
fed
up
,
and
why
should
n't
he
be
?
He
was
fed
up
with
the
whole
situation
,
and
all
Francesca
's
family
.
"
Sir
-
John
,
is
there
anything
more
tonight
?
"
He
came
back
smartly
to
the
office
and
the
desk
on
which
he
was
leaning
.
"
No
,
sorry
.
Have
you
eaten
since
lunch
?
"
"
A
sandwich
and
lots
of
coffee

Davidson
brought

"
I
'm

pub

my
way
home
.
Come
with
me

"
"
Thank
you

'd

"
She
smiled
at
him
and
he
smiled
back
,
cheered
by
the
thought
of
a
drink
and
something
to
eat
in
her
company
.
He
collected
her
as
soon
as
they
had
both
tidied
their
offices
,
McLeish
maliciously
enjoying
Davidson
's
obvious
chagrin
as
they
said
good-night
to
him
on
the
way
out
.
"
A
good
man
,
that
,
"
he
said
,
guiltily
,
to
Catherine
as
they
went
down
in
the
lift
.
"
One
of
the
best
.
I
want
to
get
him
up
to
Inspector
as
soon
as
possible
.
"
"
He

been
very
helpful

"
McLeish
repressed
a
grin
and
bustled
into
the
big
noisy
pub
on
the
corner
,
receiving
an
instant
acknowledgement
from
one
of
the
bartenders
,
who
all
knew
any
member
of
the
C1
hierarchy
.
McLeish
carried
over
a
loaded
tray
,
and
ate
ravenously
,
noting
with
interest
that
Catherine
Crane
had
an
equally
good
appetite
,
though
it
was
not
obvious
where
she
was
putting
it
on
that
slim
frame
.
She
caught
his
eye
and
laughed
.
"
I
have
to
eat
about
five
times
a
day

just
stop
in

tracks
.
"
She
licked
her
fingers
and
applied
herself
to
her
beer
.
Like
Francesca
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
irritably
suppressed
the
reflection
.
"
Tell
me
about
you

Did
you

"
No

came
straight
to
the
Met
from
school
at
eighteen
.
"
Left
home

she
could

McLeish
observed
,
instead
of
starting
where
she
could
work
from
home
.
"

"
"
Yes
,

're
still
there

"
She
was
looking
wooden
,
and
McLeish
decided
to
move
off
this
point
,
but
she
forestalled
him
.
"
It
's
my
stepfather

mother

four
half-brothers

sisters

at
work

I
was
three

"
Does
n't

on
with

McLeish
noted
mentally
,
listening
to
the
colour
in
her
voice
.
"
Where
are
you
living
now
?
"
"
I

"
McLeish
asked
whereabouts
and
discovered
it
was
three
roads
away
from
his
own
flat
,
so
they
complained
enjoyably
to
each
other
about
the
local
council
.
"
You

graduate
entry

she
asked
as
this
conversation
ran
out
,
"
and
in
the
Flying
Squad
?
"
McLeish
,
warmed
by
the
fact
that
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
find
out
a
bit
about
him
,
confirmed
he
had
been
at
Reading
University
and
had
worked
as
a
young
sergeant
in
the
Flying
Squad
.
"
I
always
heard
graduates

"
"
That
's
right
.
The
guv'nor
there
,
when
he
was
offered
me

wanted
quite
seriously
to
know
what
use
I
would
be
.
It
's
changing
now
.
But
they
took
me
in
then
because
one
of
my
mates
in
the
London
Scottish
was
in
the
Squad

They
gave
me
a
bad
time

all
been
in

they
were
seventeen
and
they
were
hard
men

But
I
got
by
on
brute
force
and
ignorance
till
I
learnt
a
bit

"
She
gave
him
a
quick
amused
glance

her
head
leaning
back
against
the
faded
red
of
the
alcove
seat

The
man

you

Alan
Jones

my
guv'nor
in
Tottenham

were
all
right

"
McLeish
beamed
at
her
,
more
than
pleased
with
this
recommendation
.
"
How
is
old
Alan
?
"
She
settled
down
to
tell
him
how
old
Alan
was
while
he
leant
forward
,
listening
with
pleasure
to
the
slightly
nasal
accent
of
Stoke
on
Trent
.
Her
judgement
of
Alan
Jones
was
both
admiring
and
shrewd
,
and
he
asked
about
her
own
education
,
becoming
aware
that
at
least
four
other
men
were
listening
with
great
interest
and
that
Catherine
Crane
was
so
used
to
this
that
she
was
unconscious
of
it
.
"

McLeish
nodded

his
impression

family
difficulty
confirmed
.

out
that
he
had
a
girlfriend
but
not
a
wife
.
"
This
is
a
good
pub
,
"
she
said
,
hastily
,
obviously
aware
of
having
trespassed
,
her
gaze
passing
over
the
heavy
plush
seating
and
lighting
on
one
of
the
barmen
who
was
openly
resting
his
eyes
on
her
as
he
polished
glasses
.
"
We
use
it
a
lot
.
"
He
followed
her
gaze
and
the
barman
lifted
his
right
hand
in
a
drink-pouring
gesture
,
nodding
at
the
same
time
towards
the
clock
which
showed
five
minutes
to
eleven
.
McLeish
indicated
equally
economically
that
no
more
drinks
would
be
required
.
"
I
've
got
my
car
in
.
Would
you
like
a
ride
home
?
"
he
asked
.
"
If
it
's
not
out
of
your
way
,
"
she
said
,
serenely
,
knowing
that
it
was
n't
,
and
McLeish
got
to
his
feet
,
savouring
self-consciously
the
sensation
of
being
whole-heartedly
envied
by
the
surrounding
male
drinkers
.
He
drove
her
sedately
home
.
Getting
out
to
open
the
passenger
door
for
her
,
he
noticed
that
,
in
contrast
to
Francesca
,
she
expected
this
and
accepted
the
courtesy
gratefully
.
"
I
'll
wait
while
you
let
yourself
in
,
"
he
said
,
in
an
attempt
at
sounding
policeman-like
,
and
she
smiled
at
him
.
"
Thanks
.
And
thanks
for
the
ride
.
"
She
had
her
key
ready
and
he
looked
down
at
her
for
a
minute
.
She
looked
back
,
her
eyes
wide
,
and
he
found
himself
holding
his
breath
.
"
Good-night
,
John
,
"
she
said
,
demurely
,
and
walked
up
her
front
steps
,
turning
to
wave
to
him
from
inside
the
house
.
The
boy
and
the
dog
skirted
round
opposite
sides
of
the
puddle
,
the
boy
,
a
light
,
tall
fourteen-year-old
,
labouring
in
wellington
boots
too
large
for
him
,
and
the
dog
,
a
three-year-old
Labrador
bitch
,
picking
her
way
reluctantly
,
with
frequent
pauses
,
as
if
her
paws
hurt
.
The
boy
,
unlike
the
dog
,
knew
that
the
mud
did
not
go
on
for
ever
;
beyond
the
bridge
,
the
disused
railway
embankment
along
which
they
were
walking
became
built
up
,
so
that
water
ran
off
it
.
He
pulled
the
dog
close
to
him
to
let
a
mixed
string
of
horses
and
Ponies
go
past
,
waving
shyly
to
the
lead
rider
,
a
pretty
,
capable
girl
an
unbridgeable
two
years
older
than
him
.
He
watched
her
as
she
went
past
at
a
walk
,
the
black
Labrador
and
he
both
gazing
wistfully
,
their
breath
steaming
in
the
cold
February
morning
.
He
waited
till
the
horses
were
well
away
and
looked
round
the
wide
,
flat
landscape
carefully
before
unclipping
the
lead
.
"
Way
you
go
,
Patty
,
"
he
said
softly
,
and
the
dog
was
off
,
hurling
herself
along
the
embankment
,
all
paws
and
flying
ears
,
after
a
rabbit
who
had
been
sitting
in
a
patch
of
sun
but
disappeared
with
contemptuous
ease
as
she
came
close
.
The
boy
had
been
told
unequivocally
not
to
let
her
off
the
lead
-
the
riding-school
only
used
the
land
by
grace
of
its
owner
and
it
was
a
shooting
estate
-
but
he
hated
keeping
the
dog
straining
at
the
lead
and
knew
that
she
would
always
come
to
his
call
.
He
stood
for
a
moment
laughing
at
her
as
she
cast
furiously
for
the
vanished
rabbit
,
and
walked
on
,
to
catch
her
up
,
along
the
raised
embankment
.
The
trees
had
grown
up
beside
it
in
the
twenty-five
years
since
the
railway
had
closed
,
and
the
boy
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
watch
small
birds
hopping
around
the
top
branches
.
He
particularly
liked
this
stretch
;
nothing
but
the
odd
tractor
and
the
horses
ever
came
down
this
embankment
,
and
the
birds
were
unworried
by
his
presence
.
After
half
a
mile
he
decided
to
turn
off
the
embankment
and
walk
up
the
side
of
the
next
field
and
along
the
path
at
the
top
of
it
,
following
the
horses
whom
he
could
still
see
in
the
distance
.
He
called
Patty
to
him
.
She
did
n't
come
,
which
was
surprising
;
she
was
a
docile
creature
and
particularly
devoted
to
him
because
he
always
took
her
for
a
walk
when
he
was
at
the
stables
.
He
could
hear
her
barking
and
looked
down
over
the
steep
side
of
the
embankment
to
the
bottom
of
the
trees
.
He
called
her
again
and
again
,
but
she
would
not
stop
barking
at
something
he
could
not
see
.
Probably
a
squirrel
,
he
decided
,
and
slithered
down
the
side
of
the
embankment
to
join
her
,
scolding
as
he
went
.
Straightening
up
beside
the
dog
,
he
looked
where
she
was
looking
,
and
blinked
.
He
saw
a
leg
,
uncomfortably
wedged
between
sapling
trees
,
swollen
grotesquely
,
and
gazed
at
it
,
stupidly
,
wondering
if
it
was
plastic
.
As
his
eyes
focused
he
realized
he
was
looking
at
a
hideously
swollen
human
body
,
and
just
then
,
as
the
light
breeze
shifted
,
he
caught
the
stomach-turning
odour
of
decay
.
He
was
a
sensible
and
capable
boy
,
an
eldest
child
,
so
he
moved
closer
,
trying
not
to
breathe
,
and
stood
steadfastly
looking
until
he
was
confident
of
what
he
had
seen
:
a
body
,
must
be
a
girl
because
it
was
wearing
a
skirt
,
lying
face
down
,
head
towards
the
bottom
of
the
embankment
as
if
she
had
dived
off
the
top
.
He
clipped
the
lead
on
to
the
dog
with
cold
hands
which
would
hardly
function
,
and
let
her
pull
him
up
the
slope
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
legs
move
.
He
stopped
on
the
embankment
,
shaking
with
cold
and
shock
,
to
note
the
spot
,
then
fled
along
the
tractor
paths
,
the
dog
running
with
him
,
to
the
stables
where
the
ten
o'clock
children
's
ride
was
in
its
closing
stages
.

The
thin
,
capable
woman
who
was
taking
the
riding-class
looked
at
him
in
amazement
as
he
leaned
panting
on
the
gate
to
the
ring
,
the
dog
whining
beside
him
.

She
had
known
him
since
he
was
a
very
small
five-year-old
,
perched
like
a
mosquito
on
one
of
the
placid
beginners
'
ponies
,
so
she
told
the
class
to
carry
on
walking
their
ponies
while
she
came
to
him
.
"

The
boy
looked
at
her
and
uncontrollable
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes
.
He
was
very
nearly
as
tall
as
her
,
but
she
put
an
arm
under
his
shoulders
and
supported
him
to
the
untidy
room
which
served
as
the
stable
office

calling
to
one
of
the
stable

to
take
over
the

scrubbed
at
his
face
with
the
handkerchief
she
offered
and
gulped
for
air
.
"

She
did
so
,
casting
an
experienced
eye
over
him
.
"

The
boy
thought
longingly
of
his
mother
,
but
managed
to
help
Miss
Williams
describe
the
location
of
the
body
to
a
startled
local
station
sergeant
and
to
drink
a
cup
of
sweet
milky
tea
without
being
sick
.
By
the
time
his
aunt
arrived
Jamie
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
refuse
to
go
home
and
to
point
out
,
severely
,
that
he
would
be
needed
,
either
to
assist
the
police
or
to
be
lead
rider
in
the
eleven-thirty
class
,
or
possibly
both
.
He
watched
his
aunt
and
Miss
Williams
wordlessly
consult
each
other
,
but
knew
his
aunt
would
do
as
she
was
told
;
successful
solicitor
though
she
was
,
she
was
ten
years
younger
than
Miss
Williams
and
,
as
she
complained
,
totally
intimidated
by
her
as
she
had
not
been
by
anyone
since
her
late
headmistress
.
He
was
unsurprised
to
find
her
packed
off
firmly
to
take
his
sister
home
,
leaving
him
as
a
person
of
major
importance
in
what
he
instantly
assumed
to
be
a
real
murder
.
Miss
Williams
took
him
to
meet
the
police
Land
Rover
at
the
stable
gate
,
a
bone-thin
,
wiry
woman
in
her
late
fifties
,
her
expression
sufficiently
forbidding
to
prevent
the
parents
,
edging
cars
through
the
gate
to
collect
children
from
the
ten
o'clock
ride
,
from
asking
any
questions
.
Jamie
,
through
a
renewed
queasiness
,
just
observed
that
the
police
driver
was
instantly
reduced
to
half
his
age
by
Miss
Williams
's
greeting
.
"
He

she
said
in
explanation
to
the
CID
sergeant
who
was
leading
the
party
as
they
bumped
over
the
rough
road
,
through
the
thick
mud
and
on
to
the
dry
embankment

The

's
eyes
widened
,

he
slid
out
of
the
Land

and
stood
back
to
let
Jamie
out

Miss

's
natural
pitch
,
well
suited
to
reaching
across
a
hunting-field
,
was
discreetly
reduced
.
The
CID
sergeant
thanked
her
gravely
and
went
to
stand
beside
Jamie
who
was
peering
down
the
embankment
,
looking
pinched

He
took
a
deep
breath
and
headed
down
,
the
sergeant
,
two
constables
and
Miss
Williams
in
his
wake
.
Soon
they
all
stood
side

side

one
of
the
younger
policemen
coughing
involuntarily
.

She
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
mopped
her
eyes
.
The
police
driver
shot
Jamie
a
look
of
enquiry
which
he
missed
,
occupied
as
he
was
with
guiding
Miss
Williams
back
up
the
hill
.
He
had
seen
her
weep
before
but
only
for
a
sick
horse
,
and
he
was
awe-struck
.
"

The
boy
blushed
to
his

owned
to
it
.
"

the
sergeant
murmured
,
and
received
the
look
that
Miss
Williams
habitually
bent
on
a
child
who
was
riding
carelessly
.
"

He
considered
the
boy
thoughtfully
,
and
decided
to
take
him
back
quickly
.
These
teenagers
were

less
tough

they
looked

could
have
been
there
much
longer
.
"
The
sergeant
nodded
,
deciding
it
could
do
no
harm
to
concede
a
point
he
had
already
taken
.
"
No
one
could
tell
who
she
was
,
surely
?
"
Miss
Williams
said
quietly
to
him
,
sounding
shaky
.
"
She
did
n't
even
look
human
.
"
The
sergeant
confirmed
that
that
happened
with
bodies
after
a
few
days
.
"
We
'll
identify
her
,
though
,
"
he
said
,
reassuringly
.
"
Somebody
will
likely
have
reported
her
missing
.
"
He
stopped
,
abruptly
,
as
he
remembered
a
conversation
earlier
that
week
,
and
lit
a
cigarette
,
thinking
furiously
.
This
could
be
the
girl
whom
the
Yard
were
looking
for
,
and
he
had
better
do
everything
very
quickly
indeed
,
including
finding
his
Chief
,
who
would
then
want
to
find
his
Chief
Constable
and
notify
Scotland
Yard
.
Presumably
it
would
be
the
Yard
who
investigated
this
one
,
rather
than
the
regional
crime
squad
.
He
chewed
his
thumbnail
as
he
walked
,
out
of
long
experience
keeping
in
mind
the
highest
priorities
:
Ensure
Body
Not
Moved
and
Ensure
Next
of
Kin
Notified
before
the
Press
got
the
story
.
He
posted
the
detective
constable
he
had
with
him
back
down
the
path
to
join
his
colleague
,
armed
with
instructions
to
repel
all
attempts
by
anyone
,
however
senior
or
armed
with
whatever
authority
,
to
go
anywhere
near
the
body
unless
he
,
Sergeant
Black
,
personally
accompanied
them
.
Then
he
climbed
into
the
Land
Rover
beside
his
two
passengers
and
drove
off
fast
,
with
the
aim
of
abandoning
Jamie
to
the
custody
of
his
aunt
as
quickly
as
possible
.
He
could
see
with
half
an
eye
that
the
kid
's
aunt
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
confident
,
bossy
,
well-connected
women
with
whom
that
part
of
Cambridgeshire
was
substantially
over-provided
.
John
McLeish
was
in
his
office
,
Saturday
or
no
Saturday
,
telling
himself
he
needed
to
catch
up
on
the
paperwork
.
The
phone
rang
and
he
picked
it
up
,
frowning
.
One
of
the
pleasures
of
Saturday
working
was
that
the
phone
did
not
ring
all
the
time
.
The
voice
at
the
other
end
was
plainly
over-excited
and
it
took
him
a
minute
to
disentangle
what
he
was
being
told
.
"
Oh
congratulations
,
Charlie
.
Sorry
,
what
did
you
say
it
was
again
?
"
"
A
little
girl
.
Actually
a
very
big
girl
as
these
things
go
,
nine
pounds
.
It
's
fantastic
,
John
,
there
she
is
,
a
new
person
,
lying
on
her
face
,
sound
asleep
.
I
've
just
left
them
and
I
'm
going
back
.
"
McLeish
repressed
the
malicious
thought
that
this
event
might
put
Francesca
's
nose
just
a
little
bit
out
of
joint
.
She
had
been
utterly
secure
in
her
position
as
the
only
girl
in
the
Wilson
family
and
now
there
was
another
one
.
"
I
've
got
another
bit
of
good
news
.
Frannie
's
going
to
be
able
to
bring
Tristram
home
pretty
soon
,
apparently
.
"
McLeish
expressed
qualified
enthusiasm
and
Charlie
assured
him
he
felt
exactly
the
same
about
his
younger
brother
.
"
The
difficulty
is
that
Perry
does
everything
that
bit
better
than
Tristram
.
Not
that
this
is
any
excuse
,
John
,
I
do
know
.
"
He
paused
,
reminding
McLeish
irresistibly
of
a
Labrador
wondering
how
best
to
approach
an
acquaintance
.
"
I
wanted
to
say
,
you
see
,
that
I
know
you
thought
Frannie
should
n't
have
gone
,
and
that
it
's
ruined
your
holiday
plans
,
and
,
on
behalf
of
us
all
,
I
'm
sorry
.
I
know
the
little
boys
lean
on
her
too
much
and
I
would
have
gone
if
I
could
.
"
He
coughed
,
embarrassed
and
a
little
pompous
,
very
much
conscious
of
his
new
status
as
a
father
,
while
McLeish
remembered
that
he
was
a
scant
four
years
older
than
the
delinquent
Tristram
.
"
Anyway
she
should
be
back
soon
,
"
Charlie
concluded
.
McLeish
thanked
him
gravely
,
feeling
,
as
he
often
did
with
the
Wilsons
,
that
he
was
being
enveloped
in
a
large
feather
eiderdown
,
and
,
made
restless
by
the
call
,
went
down
the
corridor
to
where
he
knew
Catherine
Crane
was
also
in
,
getting
her
office
in
order
.
He
stopped
at
the
door
and
smiled
at
her
.
Wearing
jeans
and
a
blue
shirt
,
she
was
tugging
at
a
filing
cabinet
which
was
too
large
for
her
to
embrace
and
which
was
threatening
to
over-balance
on
her
.
She
looked
about
sixteen
and
beautiful
.
She
let
go
of
the
cabinet
,
coughing
in
the
dust
of
ages
that
appeared
to
be
lurking
behind
it
,
and
smiled
back
at
him
as
the
February
sun
shone
through
the
small
window
behind
her
,
throwing
into
sharp
relief
the
patches
on
the
wall
where
her
predecessor
had
hung
posters
,
and
the
ingrained
dirt
on
the
flaking
paintwork
round
the
mean
,
narrow
,
metal
window
.
"
Where
do
you
want
that
put
?
"
McLeish
advanced
on
the
cabinet
and
shifted
it
authoritatively
,
ignoring
the
clip
on
the
ankle
dealt
him
by
an
unsecured
bottom
drawer
apparently
full
of
bricks
.
"
I
should
have
unloaded
it
first
,
"
Catherine
Crane
said
,
apologetically
,
"
but
I
just
could
n't
move
in
any
direction
with
it
where
it
was
.
"
"
I
'm
here
,
just
tell
me
if
you
want
anything
else
shifted
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
I
'm
going
to
do
another
hour
,
then
have
some
lunch
,
if
you
want
to
come
?
"
He
was
aware
that
he
was
not
managing
to
sound
exactly
like
a
senior
officer
making
a
recent
arrival
feel
at
home
,
but
decided
not
to
add
any
further
riders
to
his
invitation
.
"
That
would
be
very
nice
.
Are
we
going
to
the
canteen
?
"
"
Not
if
I
can
help
it
.
What
about
the
pub
?
"
If
I
'm
allowed
to
buy
my
own
.
"
McLeish
considered
.
"
That
's
fine
on
the
food
-
I
'll
buy
the
drinks
,
I
'm
too
old
to
get
used
to
women
buying
my
drinks
.
"
She
laughed
at
him
and
said
gravely
that
she
would
be
happy
to
indulge
him
,
and
he
went
away
,
grinning
.
Peter
Yeo
was
also
in
his
office
,
having
told
his
wife
he
was
lunching
with
a
client
.
It
was
,
he
felt
,
just
too
difficult
to
be
at
home
at
all
,
with
Claudia
in
a
permanently
bitchy
mood
and
both
his
teenage
children
taking
their
cue
from
her
and
behaving
intolerably
.
He
wandered
restlessly
about
,
and
decided
that
the
lie
might
as
well
become
the
truth
.
Without
Angela
Morgan
,
at
least
two
major
clients
were
in
danger
of
not
getting
the
assiduous
service
they
were
paying
for
,
and
it
would
be
well
worth
trying
to
see
if
one
of
them
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
fellow
refugee
from
family
life
at
the
weekends
,
could
be
found
.
He
was
in
luck
,
and
fixed
to
meet
Andy
Barton
at
Brazzo
's
where
Yeo
Davis
had
a
table
permanently
booked
.
He
had
to
admit
that
this
particular
client
hardly
added
to
the
general
decorative
smartness
of
the
place
.
Andy
Barton
,
founder
and
chief
executive
of
Barton
Textiles
,
was
almost
as
broad
as
he
was
long
,
virtually
neckless
,
with
incongruously
long
brown
hair
curling
over
his
collar
.
His
enormous
hands
dwarfed
the
elegant
menu
which
he
was
studying
in
apparent
disbelief
,
and
Peter
Yeo
noticed
again
,
as
Barton
without
rising
extended
one
massive
paw
,
that
though
the
fingers
were
an
ordinary
length
it
was
the
width
of
the
palms
that
made
the
hands
so
large
.
"
I
never
see
how
they
get
the
sales
per
square
foot
in
these
places
,
"
Barton
observed
,
without
further
greeting
.
"
I
mean
,
they
're
not
open
twelve
hours
like
my
shops
,
and
they
are
n't
using
the
space
.
"
His
small
bright
blue
eyes
swept
disparagingly
over
the
minimalized
black
and
white
flooring
,
stainless
steel
chairs
and
black
wooden
bar
.
"
They
make
a
huge
margin
on
a
smaller
turnover
,
Andy
,
out
of
punters
like
us
.
"
Peter
Yeo
was
amused
by
,
and
respectful
of
,
a
man
with
an
obsession
.
"
Angela
not
working
today
?
"
Barton
worked
a
sixteen-hour
day
,
which
began
with
careful
,
detailed
consideration
of
the
trading
figures
and
key
ratios
for
every
one
of
his
forty-three
major
shops
and
the
output
of
both
factories
,
and
continued
,
usually
by
helicopter
,
with
a
detailed
aerial
survey
of
a
particular
area
as
the
quick
way
of
identifying
new
sites
,
interspersed
with
unheralded
descents
on
the
manager
of
any
shop
he
took
a
fancy
to
visit
.
Peter
Yeo
,
who
had
known
this
particular
juggernaut
since
he
had
his
first
small
factory
and
two
stores
and
dirt
under
his
fingernails
from
shifting
packing-cases
personally
,
was
not
fazed
by
the
question
.
"
Angela
's
taking
a
few
days
off
-
she
has
n't
been
well
,
"
he
said
,
easily
.
"
I
know
she
's
been
working
very
hard
for
you
.
I
'm
up
to
speed
with
Huerter
,
of
course
,
but
is
your
planning
application
in
Leicester
all
right
?
"
Barton
assured
him
warmly
that
Angela
had
done
a
great
job
and
he
was
now
confident
of
getting
planning
permission
on
the
vast
site
he
had
wanted
.
Peter
Yeo
,
who
knew
him
in
this
over-candid
,
over-emphatic
mood
,
decided
to
prod
gently
.
"
Angela
said
the
council
wanted
it
for
housing
?
"
"
Yeah
,
some
of
them
did
.
Silly
buggers
,
it
's
jobs
they
want
there
first
.
Plenty
of
housing
if
those
stupid
farts
at
the
council
got
round
to
repairing
it
and
stopped
their
tenants
tearing
apart
what
they
have
got
.
My
Mum
brought
up
five
of
us
in
a
flat
far
worse
than
what
these
immigrants
complain
about
.
"
Peter
Yeo
,
who
had
personally
persuaded
Barton
of
the
presentational
disadvantage
of
using
words
like
"
darkies
"
,
"
niggers
"
or
"
wogs
"
,
decided
that
"
immigrants
"
even
though
used
in
the
manner

one
invoking
a
curse
,
was
as
good
as
he
was
going
to
get
with
this
particular
client
.
"
She
's

a
good
job

Bloody
ridiculous
them
blokes
at
the
DTI
pushing
assistance
for
Huerter

I
voted
for
this
government
because
they
said
they
were
n't
going
to
go
in
for
that
sort
of
rubbish
.
No
one
ever
gave
me
anything

my
business
works
.

,
Angie
can
fix
the
Treasury
on
this
one

given
her
boyfriend

ca
n't
she
?
That
's
the
reason
I
wanted
you
on
this
.
"
Peter
Yeo
winced
inwardly
,
but
he
was
not
going
to
tell
Andy
Barton
that
Angela
was
missing
,
or
express
any
of
his
reservations
about
how
much
influence
Angela
could
bring
to
bear
.
He
smoothly
changed
the
subject
to
the
looks
of
the
blond
model
,
three
tables
away
,
and
Barton
agreed
he
would
n't
mind
a
bit
of
that
;
on
the
thin
side
,
mind
you
,
but
tasty
.
The
rest
of
lunch
passed
in
similar
diversion
,
interspersed
with
details
of
last
week
's
turnover
which
were
never
far
from
Barton
's
mind
,
whatever
other
distractions
offered
.
Mrs
Huntley
was
having
lunch
with
her
daughter
.
She
ate
placidly
,
acknowledging
to
herself
with
her
customary
good
sense
that
at
the
moment
,
as
at
any
time
since
her
brother
William
had
died
,
she
and
Penelope
were
getting
no
pleasure
at
all
from
each
other
's
company
.
Penelope
was
looking
particularly
discontented
and
disaffected
,
picking
at
her
food
.
Her
red
suit
was
smart
,
but
too
bright
a
colour
for
her
pale
English
pink
and
white
skin
,
her
brown
hair
could
have
done
with
a
wash
and
her
nails
were
ragged
and
bitten
.
She
was
frowning
,
deep
lines
appearing
between
her
eyebrows
,
mouth
drawn
down
at
the
edges
so
that
instead
of
a
classically
good-looking
slim
English
Rose
in
her
late
twenties
,
she
looked
faded
,
years
older
than
her
real
age
,
and
shrewish
.
Mrs
Huntley
sighed
;
her
brother
whom
she
had
loved
,
but
knew
to
be
self-indulgent
to
a
fault
,
had
done
his
niece
real
harm
by
leaving
so
much
of
his
money
away
from
the
girl
who
had
confidently
believed
herself
to
be
his
favourite
thing
on
earth
.
Penelope
,
however
,
it
had
to
be
acknowledged
,
had
made
no
attempt
to
rise
above
the
blow
she
had
been
dealt
by
finding
a
dazzling
girl
of
her
own
age
favoured
over
herself
in
her
uncle
's
will
.
At
least
,
Mrs
Huntley
thought
hopefully
,
she
had
stopped
wondering
,
unbecomingly
and
stridently
,
how
her
uncle
could
have
been
fooled
by
Angela
Morgan
.
It
was
Grizel
Huntley
's
own
view
that
her
brother
had
not
been
fooled
at
all
but
had
been
charmed
and
diverted
by
a
dashing
girl
thirty
years
his
junior
,
and
had
seen
no
reason
at
all
why
she
should
not
have
a
share
of
his
considerable
estate
when
that
left
a
very
decent
down-setting
for
his
niece
as
well
.
Indeed
,
she
had
respected
Angela
Morgan
for
the
straightforwardness
with
which
she
had
tackled
the
issue
when
they
had
met
at
the
lawyer
's
office
.
"
I
'm
sorry
you
're
disappointed
,
"
she
had
said
to
Penelope
,
"
but
after
all
there
's
a
lot
of
money
,
quite
enough
for
both
of
us
.
"
So
there
was
,
Grizel
Huntley
acknowledged
,
and
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
Penny
could
manage
to
think
a
bit
more
positively
.
"
If
she
has
vanished
,
I
'm
going
to
see
that
solicitor
about
whether
I
can
get
her
presumed
dead
.
"
Penny
,
sounding
childishly
,
sullenly
determined
,
broke
into
her
mother
's
thoughts
.
Grizel
Huntley
looked
across
at
her
,
shocked
.
"
I
would
wait
a
little
if
I
were
you
.
"
Penelope
glared
at
her
,
turning
an
ungraceful
scarlet
,
but
Mrs
Huntley
held
her
ground
.
"
You
are
being
silly
about
this
,
Penny
.
You
are
letting
this
disappointment
-
and
that
's
all
it
is
,

're
still
a
very
well-off
young
woman
-
get
in
the
way
of
everything
.
"
Penelope
choked
on
her
pudding
and
started
to
cry
,
angry
,
uncontrollable
tears
.
Grizel
Huntley
reached
out
to
comfort
her
but
she
forced
back
her
chair
and
fled
,
clutching
her
handbag
and
napkin
,
leaving
her
mother
with
the
ruins
of
lunch
.
Fifty
miles
north
,
Sarah
Morgan
had
just
finished
serving
a
lunch
that
no
one
had
done
more
than
pick
at
.
Her
husband
Francis
had
made
a
slightly
better
showing
than
her
daughter
Jennifer
,
who
was
looking
particularly
ragged
.
Mother
and
daughter
were
very
like
each
other
,
tall
,
dark
,
slim
,
pleasant-looking
women
with
mid-brown
curly
hair
and
slightly
snub
noses
.
Francis
Morgan
,
by
contrast
,
was
dark
,
almost
black-haired
,
sallow-skinned
,
with
bright
brown
eyes
.
Of
medium
height
and
packed
with
energy
,
even
distressed
as
he
was
,
he
was
bursting
round
the
kitchen
,
hair
still
damp
at
the
back
from
his
swim
.
"

Jennifer
sounded
defeated
,
and
he
looked
at
her
sideways
with
familiar
love
and
exasperation
.
She
just
did
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
hang
on
to
men

he
thought
impatiently

his
Angie

she
was
.
"
Giles
rang
up
,
"
his
daughter
volunteered
,
and
he
was
uncomfortably
reminded
by
something
in
her
voice
that
Giles
Hawick
was
one
of
the
men
Jennifer
had
n't
been
able
to
hang
on

had
seen
Angela

his
wife
Sarah
asked
,
rather
too
quickly
.
"
Well

very
worried

He
said
the
police
were
talking
to
everyone
Angie
had
seen
in
the
two
weeks
before
she
-
well
-
vanished
,
and
so
far
had
come
up
with
nothing
.
I
mean
no
one
noticed
anything
unusual
about
her
and
she
seemed
to
be
full
of
plans
for
the
wedding
.
"
"
Well
,
I
told

Francis
Morgan
said
irritably
and
his
wife
and
daughter
caught
each
other
's
eye
in
silent
agreement
that
he
had
n't
told
them
that
Angela
was
refusing
point-black
to
be
married
from
home
and
was
insisting
on
the
full
London
set-out
,
reception
at
the
House
of
Commons
,
replying
unanswerably
when
he
had
objected
on
grounds
of
expense
that
she
could
well
afford
to
pay
for
it
herself
.
A
row
of
epic
proportions
had
ensued
,
which
he
and
Angela
had
evidently
enjoyed
but
which
had
left
Sarah
and
Jennifer
sick
with
distress
.
"

Sarah
Morgan
was
sounding
diffident
but
resolute
,
and
as
Morgan
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
in
exasperation
the
doorbell
rang
.
Both
women
looked
at
him
in
joint
appeal
and
he
marched
to
the
door
,
pulling
it
open
with
unnecessary
force
.
He
stood
,
door

,
checked
by
something
in
the
way
his
visitors
,
a
man
and
a

,
were
standing
.

man

a
stocky

greying
fifty-year-old
in
a
navy
raincoat
over
a
suit
,
his
hair
cut
short
,
was
attended
by
a
uniformed
policewoman
,
hair
smartly
set
under
the
cap
,
her
eyes
watchful
in
the
wide
,
flat
,
placid
face
,
and
both
of
them
were
standing
square
and
stolid
.
Francis
Morgan
stood
and
stared
at
them
,
and
even
before
the
man
stepped
forward
steadily
,
hand
extended
,
mouth
opening
to
speak
,
he
understood

Francis
Morgan
subsided
abruptly
on
one
of
the
uncomfortable
chesterfields
in
the
sunny
,
cramped
,
living-room
and
Detective
Inspector
Teversham
shifted
uncomfortably
,
wishing
the
phone
call
would
come
.
The
phone
rang
.
He
sprang
to
it
,
and
collected
instructions
in
a
room
silent
except
for
the
sound
of
Mrs
Morgan
weeping
drearily
into
her
handkerchief
.
With
one
part
of
his
mind
he
logged
the
fact
that
Mum
had
understood
the
worst
immediately
and
must
in
some
way
have
been
expecting
it
.
The
deceased
had
been
Daddy
's
girl
,
then
-
although
it
was
usually
the
dads
,
where
a
daughter
was
in
question
,
who
fought
against
the
realization
of
the
truth
.
His
WPC
was
looking
at
him
anxiously
for
guidance
,
but
he
shook
his
head
at
her
slightly
and
waited
,
standing
squarely
on
both
feet
as
he
had
done
in
many
trying
circumstances
before
.
"

Mrs

made
a
movement
of
protest

Francis

looked
to

for
support

He
watched
,
stolidly
,
as
Mrs
Morgan
disappeared
to
the
kitchen
to
show
the
sergeant
what
was
what
and
considered
,
without
watching
her
,
the
other
Miss
Morgan
.
She
was
n't
crying
her
eyes
out
.
She
was
pale
,
but
not
as
shocked
as
she
might
have
been
.
Well
,
that
was
all
right
-
she
could
look
after
Mum
in
the
hour
that
was
to
follow
while
the
identity
of
the
body
was
established
,
and
in
all
the
grim
hours
after
that
,
if
the
body
was
her
sister
.
He
gently
insisted
that
Francis
Morgan
got
a
cup
of
tea
,
with
sugar
,
down
him
before
he
escorted
him
out
to
the
waiting
car
.
He
sat
in
the
back
with
him
,
for
company
,
and
chatted
soothingly
of
nothing
as
the
driver
did
the
eight
miles
or
so
to
Kirton
,
and
swept
into
the
riding-school
yard
.
Evidently
a
class
had
just
finished
and
the
place
was
boiling
with
ponies
,
small
children
,
pink-faced
with
exertion
in
oversized
helmets
covered
with
bright
silks
,
parents
urging
them
to
hurry
up
and
get
in
cars
,
and
teenage
girls
bulging
out
of
light
jodhpurs
organizing
the
whole
.
A
still
point
in
this
maelstrom
was
Sergeant
Black
,
who
had
tucked
himself
between
two
of
the
sheltering
twelve-foot
evergreens
planted
to
cut
off
the
east
wind
from
the
ring
.
The
man
moved
efficiently
past
a
child
who
had
succeeded
in
entangling
her
pony
's
reins
with
her
feet
and
who
was
being
blasted
for
it
by
a
girl
who
could
n't
have
been
more
than
sixteen
,
but
was
sounding
like
a
woman
three
times
her
age
.
Precisely
who
it
was
she
was
using
for
a
role
model
became
clear
as
a
middle-aged
lady
,
admirably
slim
in
well-cut
jodhpurs
,
erupted
from
some
inner
fortress
to
enquire
,
in
tones
that
carried
effortlessly
across
the
yard
,
precisely
why
Caroline
had
failed
to
run
up
her
stirrups
,
how
long
had
she
been
riding
?
The
tone
was
uncompromising
but
somehow
neutral
,
and
the
child
addressed
hastened
to
make
the
adjustment
,
rebuked
but
not
embarrassed
or
crushed
.
Teversham
stopped
where
he
was
,
saw
Miss
Williams
notice
him
,
and
waited
patiently
while
she
dispatched
four
of
the
assorted
teenagers
to
a
distant
meadow
with
eight

A

just
pulling
up
at
the

up

John
McLeish
considered
this
admirably
succinct

decided
the

he
added
,
in
explanation
and
Teversham
had
just
time
to
assure
him
he
well
understood

would

down

introduced
himself
and
Catherine
in
suitably
subdued
tones
.
Even
through
his
distress
,
Francis
Morgan
was
obviously
struck
by
Catherine
Crane
's
looks
and
as
the
party
distributed
itself
into
the
big
Land
Rover
he
managed
to
sit
next
to
her
.
McLeish
,
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
huddled
on
the
uncomfortable
bench-seating
,
could
smell
the
faint
perfume
she
wore
and
thought
,
with
what
detachment
he
could
bring
to
bear
,
that
one
of
the
minor
complications
of
this
case
was
going
to
be
the
reactions
of
every
man
involved
as
suspect
,
colleague
or
witness
,
to
this
beauty
he
had
managed
to
import
on
to
his
staff
.
The
Land
Rover
bumped
along
the
track
to
where
the
young
detective
constable
,
looking
chilled
and
ti
red
,
was
waiting
for
them
.
As
they
decanted
themselves
McLeish
managed
to
agree
quickly
with
Teversham
that
,
assuming
the
identification
was
confirmed
,
he
would
take
Francis
Morgan
and
Miss
Williams
back
,
leaving
Catherine
and
himself
at
the
site
.
He
waited
tactfully
with
Catherine
and
the
young
constable
on
the
embankment
,
liking
the
sweep
of
the
country
as
it
spread
out
in
the
raw
,
cold
day
.
"

only

he
observed
to
Catherine
who
pointed
out
it
was
n't
much
of
a
hill
,
more
a
fifty-foot
ridge
,
it
just
looked
high
in
this
dead
flat
plain
.

he
said
,
repressively
,
uneasily
conscious
that
he
had
given
Francesca
no
thought
at
all
that
day
and
did
n't
much
want
to
think
about
her
now
.
Catherine
Crane
fell
silent
,
and
he
fished
out
the
one-page
note
Teversham
had
handed
him
and
read
it
,
scowling
.
"
Good
God
,
"
he
said
,
involuntarily
,
and
Catherine
looked
at
him
enquiringly
.
"

.
How
do

know
him
?
"
McLeish
hesitated
,
then
said
stiffly
that
he
was
Francesca
's
godson
,
and
also
something
like
her
third
cousin
,
or
his
mother
was
.
He
glanced
down
the
slope
and
realized
the
party
was
returning
.
Francis
Morgan
white-faced
and
dazed
,
Miss
Williams
supporting
his
elbow
,
equally
white
and
trying
not
to
cry
.
Teversham
,
at
Morgan
's
other
side
,
nodded
to
McLeish
in
confirmation
,
pro
forma
.
The
small
group
struggled
up
the
last
piece
of
the
embankment
,
Teversham
necessarily
in
the
rear
and
Francis
Morgan
stumbled
almost
on
to
McLeish
's
feet
.
McLeish
reached
out
to
steady
him
and
the
man
looked
up
at
him
,
unseeingly
.

as

Francis
Morgan
looked
from
him
to

,
obviously
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing

in
an
agony
of
loss

asked

abruptly

The
bright
brown
eyes
rested
on
her
and
you
could
see
written
all
over
his
face
the
jealousy
that
this
girl
,
daughter
to
some
man
,
was
still
alive
while
his
child
was
gone

Teversham
and
his
sergeant
closed
round
Morgan
,
shepherding
him
to
the
waiting
Land
Rover
with
meaningless
gentle
instructions
to
watch
the
step

McLeish
glanced
up
the
track
to
see
,
in
the
distance
,
another
Land
Rover
swaying
over
the
rough
bits
,
and
touched
Teversham
's
elbow
.
"
That
's
my
lot

think

Teversham
nodded
in
acknowledgement
.
"

Williams
,
we
'll
find
the
road

"
"
Do

McLeish
said
urgently
.
"
Sorry

but
if
there
was
a
vehicle
involved
it
probably
came

No

on
this
side
,
except

.
"
"
Damn
.
"
Teversham
was
unnerved
by
the
nearness
of
the
following
Land
Rover
and
irritated
with
himself
for
missing
an
elementary
point
.
In
the
end
it
took
ten
minutes
to
get
the
Cambridgeshire
police
Land
Rover
turned
past
McLeish
's
squad
and
their
vans
,
and
away
back
up
to
the
stable
.
Teversham
had
agreed
to
call
the
AC
at
the
yard
and
report
that
the
identification
had
been
confirmed
,
so
that
he
could
go
and
see
Giles
Hawick
.
Francis
Morgan
would
no
doubt
ring
him
too
,
but
he
was
naturally
so
shaken
that
McLeish
thought
that
small
piece
of
insurance
worthwhile
.
He
watched
them
out
of
sight
,
then
turned
to
his
squad
.
"
Right

go

He
glanced
down
the
slope
wishing
he
had
brought
boots
;
his
shoes
were
already
letting
in
mud
.
He
looked
at
Catherine
Crane
's
feet
and
saw
she
was
in
a
similar
situation
.
The
sergeant
from
the
scene
of
crime
squad
pushed
past
him
,
and
advanced
on
Catherine
Crane
,
holding
out
a
pair
of
battered
wellingtons
with
the
air
of
the
prince
hopefully
extending
a
glass
slipper
.
"
They
'll
be
too
big
,
Sergeant
,
but
maybe
better
than
your
shoes
?
We
have
some
spare
socks
,
too
.
"
McLeish
watched
her
melting
smile
,
as
did
every
man
in
the
group
.
"
Got
anything
there
to
fit
me
?
"
he
asked
pointedly
,
and
a
young
constable
reluctantly
transferred
his
attention
.
Kitted
up
some
five
minutes
later
with
a
pair
a
good
size
too
small
and
with
a
hole
in
the
right
toe
,
McLeish
led
his
troops
into
action
.
The
smell
hit
them
as
they
slithered
to
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
McLeish
resolutely
took
a
breath
before
walking
over
to
where
the
swollen
body
lay
.
It
was
,
as
usual
,
not
the
person
who
lay
dead
but
the
shell
in
which
the
person
had
lived
.
The
girl
that
was
Angela
Morgan
had
looked
out
of
the
photograph
,
whereas
what
lay
on
the
ground
,
arms
outstretched
,
could
have
been
any
young
woman
with
dark
hair
.
The
well-defined
features
of
the
photograph
had
vanished
,
the
face
had
swollen
in
death
as
had
the
exposed
arms
.
Thank
God
it
was
n't
high
summer
,
McLeish
thought
,
stepping
back
almost
on
to
Catherine
's
toes
and
reaching
for
his
handkerchief
;
the
cold
,
particularly
at
night
,
would
have
retarded
decay
.
The
girl
had
been
missing
for
what
-
a
week
?
-
and
off-hand
he
agreed
with
the
local
man
's
judgement
that
she
had
been
here
for
most
of
it
.
The
sapling
trees
had
grown
tall
in
the
twenty-five
years
since
the
Beeching
axe
had
fallen
on
the
single
railway
track
,
and
,
even
leafless
as
they
were
,
they
effectively
screened
the
view
from
the
top
.
A
thick
hedge
shielded
her
from
the
field
which
swept
down
towards
the
foot
of
the
embankment
.
Whoever
had
brought
her
here
must
have
known
the
place
;
you
could
n't
have
picked
it
out
in
a
hurry
.
The
country
is
not
as
deserted
as
all
that
,
as
McLeish
,
brought
up
in
a
village
in
Leicestershire
,
well
knew
.
There
are
always
people
about
,
in
tractors
,
walking
or
riding
;
there
is
always
an
inquisitive
dog
.
He
stopped
at
this
thought
,
wondering
if
dogs
came
along
here
frequently
.
"
Careful
round
the
body
,
"
he
said
unnecessarily
to
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
squad
,
who
was
matter-of-factly
distributing
heavy-duty
surgical
masks
.
He
looked
round
for
Catherine
and
found
she
had
vanished
.
"
Back
that
way
,
sir
,
"
one
of
the
squad
volunteered
,
barely
intelligible
through
his
mask
,
and
McLeish
saw
her
,
twenty
yards
away
,
walking
back
slowly
towards
them
,
head
bowed
.
"
All
right
?
"
he
asked
as

plunged
up

turned

extended
a

up

stood

stood
awkwardly
by

for
a

crying

said

watching

fought
back

her
away

down

saw
a

off

tried
to

the

been

realized
he
had
no

had
moved

she
was

McLeish
thanked
him

scrambled
up
the

,
drawing
in
deep
breaths
,

walked
carefully
down
the
side
of
the
track
in
the
sizeable
footsteps

raided
the

pressed
both

Even
in
the
twenty
minutes
it
had
taken
to
get
some
nourishment
,
the
light
had
faded
and
the
dull
day
was
darkening
into
a
cold
night
;
the
beginnings
of
a
frost
crackled
under
their
feet
as
they
walked
briskly
along
the
embankment
.
The
long
ridge
to
their
left
looked
particularly
bleak
and
lifeless
,
the
heavy
clay
sitting
solidly
in
the
ridges
where
the
plough
had
left
it
months
before
,
no
trace
of
last
year
's
crop

nothing
to
indicate

was

tops
of
the
sapling
trees
,
waist-high
at
the
edge
of
the
embankment

were
leafless
and
still

bad

cold
night

lie
out
in

had

remind
himself
that

dead
girl
behind
them

have
felt
none

this
dank
chill

was
almost
totally
dark
when
they
arrived
in
the
stable
yard
and
Catherine
jumped
involuntarily
as
something
moved
and
rattled
against
the
boards
.

very
forlorn

big
parking

he

it

a
hand
on
his
shoulder

took
a
lot
to
faze
a
talented
one
like
that

who
had
been
a
successful
soloist
for
two
years

managing
with
having
a
sick
father
and
about
one
tenth
of
his
mother

attention

realized
the
boy
had
grown
in
the
two
months
since
he
had
last
seen
him

looked
at
him
carefully
,
noticing
the
way
his
wrists
poked
out
of
the
shirt
and
the
slight
roughness
of
the
clear
skin
.

admirable
good

was
being
issued
with
soap
and
hand-towels

Miss
Williams

took
Jamie
quickly
through
his
story
,
finding
him
healthily
excited
by
his
part
in
it
,
but
with
an
obvious
undercurrent
of
anxiety

how

closed

eyes

ecstasy

flung
himself
on

at
the

"
"
Do
you

She
gave
him
a
level
look
,
understanding
that
he
must
be
working
,
as
they
say
,
on
information
received
.
Quick
,
as
her
dead
sister
must
have
been
.
"
We
did
go
out
together
a
few
times

Chief
Inspector

I
liked
him
,
but
he
and
Angela
are
-
were

better
suited
to
each
other
.
"
It
must
have
been
painful
to
have
a
man
you
liked
appropriated
by
a
younger
sister
,
McLeish
thought
,
but
this
self-contained
creature
was
not
going
to
tell
him
-
or
possibly
anyone
else
-
how
it
had
felt
.
He
considered
her
,
as
he
went
through
the
routine
questions
about
when
she
had
last
seen
her
sister
.
"
We
did
n't
meet
very
often
in
London
unless
it
was
a
party
.
I
work
in
the
British
Museum
,
and
my
flat
is
quite
close
to
it
.
I

Assistant

McLeish
blinked
involuntarily
,
and
she
smiled
faintly
.
"
I
read
Middle
Eastern
Languages
,
and
spent
a
year
in
Turkey
after
Oxford
,
then
came
back
to
the
Museum
.
I
specialize
in
fourteenth-century
ceramics
.
"
It
was
a
less
lively
face
than
her
sister
's
because
it
was
more
turned
in
,
more
contemplative
,
less
concerned
with
the
things
of
this
world
.
Well
,
fourteenth-century
Turkey
must
be
pretty
safely
removed
from
the
things
of
this
world
.
He
considered
her
good
but
unremarkable
clothes
,
and
wondered
what
she
did
for
laughs
.
Or
was
fourteenth-century
Turkey
laughs
enough
,
what
did
he
know
?
He
fell
back
on
routine
and
asked
Jennifer
to
confirm
exactly
when
she
had
last
seen
Angela
.
"
I
last
saw
her
here
,
the
weekend
before
she
disappeared
.
She
came
up
here
for
a
night
to
see
Mummy
,
to
sort
out
some
details
about
the
wedding
.
"
"
That
must
be
a
lot
of
work
for
your
mother
,
"
McLeish
said
,
hopefully
,
and
got
another
level
,
distantly
amused
look
.
"
You
would
have
to
ask
her
that
.
My
impression
was
that
since
it
was
to
be
held
in
London
,
Angela
was
doing
the
work
,
with
a
good
deal
of
help
from
colleagues
at
Yeo
Davis
.
They
have
a
lot
of
experience
of
large
parties
.
"
Ouch
,
McLeish
thought
,
not
such
a
gentle
,
distant
academic
,
are
you
?
A
very
sardonic
eye
there
indeed
.
"
We
talked
to
Mr
Yeo
when
your
sister
was
reported
missing
.
He
obviously
considered
your
sister
a
very
valuable
colleague
.
"
"
She
is
-
was
-
extremely
competent
,
as
well
as
very
good
at
getting
on
with
people
,
which
is
of
course
critical
to
jobs
like
that
.
I
imagine
she
will
be
very
much
missed
.
"
She
looked
sharply
out
of
the
window
and
produced
a
handkerchief
which
she
held
clenched
in
her
hand
but
did
not
use
.
"
Miss
Morgan
,
would
you
like
to
stop
for
a
minute
?
Can
we
get
you
some
more
coffee
?
"
McLeish
glanced
at
Catherine
who
was
already
on
her
feet
,
and
Jennifer
Morgan
nodded
in
acquiescence
.
"
I
'm
sorry
.
I
'll
just
go
and
tidy
up
.
"
She
got
up
stiffly
and
went
upstairs
,
holding
blindly
on
to
the
banisters
.
McLeish
joined
Catherine
in
the
comfortable
modern
kitchen
where
they
foraged
companionably
for
coffee
and
milk
,
waiting
until
they
heard
Jennifer
Morgan
come
down
again
.
"
I
'm
sorry
,
"
she
said
,
wearily
.
"
Where
were
we
?
My
mother
is
coming
in
a
minute
.
"
"
We
were
asking
about
your
sister
's
position
at
Yeo
Davis
.
I
think
you
had
made
it
clear
that
Mr
Yeo
very
much
valued
her
.
Would
she
have
wanted
to
continue
working
there
after
she
was
married
?
"
Jennifer
Morgan
looked
at
him
quickly
and
he
realized
he
must
have
stumbled
on
something
.
But
she
knew
her
hesitation
had
given
him
a
lead
.
"
She
would
have
wanted
to
continue
,
yes
.
There
might
have
been
some
difficulty
there
because
of
Giles
"
s
position
,
because
of
the
conflict
of
interest
.
Yeo
Davis
exists
to
lobby
government
and
Giles
is
a
Minister
.
"
She
sounded
like
Francesca
when
she
talked
about
Yeo
Davis
,
McLeish
reflected
.
"
Did
he
want
her
to
give
it
up
?
"
"
Yes
,
he
did
.
He
found
it
awkward
,
but
Angela
was
-
naturally
-
reluctant
.
"
Some
colour
had
come
back
into
Jennifer
's
face
.
So
he
talked
to
you
about
it
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
saw
Catherine
register
the
same
point
.
He
decided
to
leave
this
one
for
the
moment
but
logged
the
fact
that
Jennifer
Morgan
had
still
been
interested
in
,
and
comfortable
with
,
the
man
who
had
become
her
sister
's
fiance
.
A
tap
on
the
door
made
them
all
start
.
Catherine
Crane
went
across
to
open
it
and
held
a
murmured
conversation
with
someone
.
Sarah
Morgan
came
in
to
the
room
like
a
ghost
,
and
McLeish
drew
breath
as
he
saw
her
.
She
was
deathly
pale
,
the
mid-brown
hair
flattened
to
her
head
,
the
lined
skin
without
make-up
except
for
a
brave
but
mistaken
line
of
smudged
lipstick
.
She
looked
at
him
dumbly
,
and
even
McLeish
's
hardened
investigator
's
nerve
failed
him
.
He
glanced
involuntarily
at
Jennifer
Morgan
who
said
she
would
make
tea
,
which
was
what
her
mother
preferred
,
and
bore
her
off
to
the
kitchen
.
They
returned
with
the
tea
accompanied
by
a
bottle
of
pills
-
Valium
,
McLeish
noticed
automatically
-
and
with
Mrs
Morgan
looking
more
gathered
.
The
buttons
of
her
cardigan
were
correctly
done
up
and
the
collar
flattened
neatly
,
the
zip
of
the
skirt
was
in
its
proper
place
at
the
side
and
her
tattered
bedroom
slippers
had
been
replaced
with
a
tidy
pair
of
court
shoes
,
the
wrong
colour
for
the
skirt
.
It
was
better
,
but
not
a
lot
,
and
McLeish
who
knew
her
to
be
in
her
late
fifties
decided
any
casual
observer
would
put
her
at
nearer
seventy
.
Jennifer
Morgan
looked
at
him
doubtfully
,
but
he
shook
his
head
to
her
implied
question
;
he
preferred
to
conduct
his
interviews
without
members
of
the
family
present
.
"
Wo
n't
be
long
,
"
he
said
,
reassuringly
,
just
managing
not
to
pat
Jennifer
Morgan
on
her
beige
cashmere
shoulder
.
He
was
extremely
gentle
with
Sarah
Morgan
,
as
he
had
implicitly
promised
her
daughter
,
but
it
was
a
desperately
painful
experience
,
and
,
he
began
to
fear
,
not
a
useful
one
.
She
had
not
seen
Angela
since
the
weekend
before
the
one
on
which
she
had
disappeared
,
but
had
spoken
to
her
twice
on
the
telephone
.
Well
yes
,
Angie
had
been
very
busy
and
preoccupied
with
the
wedding
preparations
,
naturally
,
but
she
had
been
happy
.
And
no
,
they
had
not
been
expecting
to
see
her
that
weekend
,
though
with
Giles
away
she
had
said
she
might
come
on
the
Sunday
.
But
she
would
have
telephoned
first
.
She
seemed
to
be
eased
by
talking
of
her
daughter
,
and
by
the
time
she
stopped
,
apologetically
,
and
drank
some
tea
poured
for
her
by
Catherine
,
she
looked
exhausted
but
less
like
a
wraith
.
She
pushed
the
Valium
aside
,
observing
that
she
did
prefer
not
to
take
drugs
,
a
reaction
so
typical
of
her
age
and
class
that
McLeish
decided
he
might
after
all
be
able
to
conduct
a
useful
interview
.
"
I
understand
it
was
your
older
daughter
who
met
Mr
Hawick
first
?
"
"
Yes
,
she
did
,
and
I
think
she
hoped
something
would
come
of
it
-
well
,
so
did
I.
But
when
he
met
Angela
he
was
just
bowled
over
by
her
.
I
was
sorry
for
Jennifer
but
they
had
only
been
going
out
for
a
month
or
so
,
and
not
terribly
seriously
.
And
in
any
case
,
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
these
attractions
,
can
you
?
"
McLeish
agreed
with
her
promptly
and
she
raised
half
a
smile
for
him
.
He
waited
,
remembering
Jennifer
Morgan
's
obvious
pain
and
wondering
what
her
mother
's
views
about
it
were
.
He
watched
her
thoughtfully
as
she
ate
a
biscuit
.
"
Angela
must
have
been
a
very
attractive
girl
,
"
he
suggested
,
cautiously
.
"
Oh
,
she
was
,
"
Sarah
Morgan
agreed
.
"
But
I
used
to
wonder
whether
she
was
ever
going
to
get
married
.
She
never
seemed
to
fall
for
anyone
her
own
age
,
they
were
always
older
.
"
She
was
talking
with
the
ease
of
total
emotional
exhaustion
.
"
Was
there
anyone
else
who
was
important
to
her
-
I
mean
before
she
met
Mr
Hawick
,
of
course
?
"
he
asked
,
vaguely
.
Mrs
Morgan
took
another
biscuit
and
accepted
another
cup
of
tea
.
"
I
did
think
that
there
was
something
between
her
and
Peter
Yeo
-
her
partner
-
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
He
has
a
wife
and
children
and
most
men
do
n't
usually
leave
their
wives
,
do
they
?
"
The
question
was
rhetorical
and
McLeish
waited
.
"
Anyway
,
Giles
was
perfect
for
her
;
fourteen
years
older
and
with
his
own
very
distinguished
career
.
I
was
sure
she
was
going
to
be
happily
settled
.
"
She
stopped
,
staring
out
of
the
window
,
her
hands
clenched
together
.
"
And
then
this
terrible
thing
happens
.
Who
could
have
wanted
to
kill
her
?
"
Francis
Morgan
did
not
bother
with
knocking
at
the
door
but
walked
in
without
apology
.
He
was
deathly
pale
and
obviously
still
in
the
first
shock
of
grief
but
it
had
taken
him
differently
.
He
was
wound
up
like
a
spring
,
furiously
angry
,
unable
to
keep
still
or
to
prevent
himself
from
fidgeting
.
"
Where
's
Sarah
?
"
he
demanded
,
and
took
in
the
scene
in
front
of
him
.
"
Why
did
n't
you
wake
me
?
"
"
I
understand
the
doctor
wanted
you
to
have
a
sleep
if
you
could
,
Mr
Morgan
"
"
Catherine
Crane
said
briskly
.
"
Would
you
like
some
tea
?
We
have
only
just
started
talking
with
Mrs
Morgan
.
"
She
looked
very
young
and
pretty
as
she
held
up
the
teapot
and
Francis
Morgan
hesitated
,
then
sat
down
,
heavily
,
and
seized
two
biscuits
.
"
Sorry
,
"
he
said
,
awkwardly
,
through
a
mouthful
of
Rich
Tea
.
"
I
ca
n't
stop
thinking
about
her
and
wondering
what
happened
.
"
He
slapped
both
hands
palms
down
on
the
table
,
slopping
his
tea
and
making
them
all
jump
,
totally
unselfconscious
in
his
misery
.
What
,
McLeish
wondered
acerbically
,
did
he
imagine
his
wife
and
surviving
daughter
were
thinking
about
-
or
did
he
assume
they
had
taken
the
death
of
a
daughter
and
a
sister
in
their
stride
?
From
under
his
eyelashes
he
could
see
Mrs
Morgan
was
watching
her
husband
with
a
sort
of
furious
compassion
,
and
was
careful
not
to
catch
her
eye
.
The
man
was
quite
literally
distracted
,
unable
to
concentrate
at
all
.
McLeish
looked
thoughtfully
at
Jennifer
Morgan
who
had
come
in
and
was
considering
her
father
with
what
he
was
startled
to
recognize
as
dislike
.
This
was
evidently
a
family
that
was
not
going
to
be
brought
closer
by
grief
.
She
nodded
to
McLeish
and
started
gently
to
bustle
her
mother
away
.
He
settled
Francis
Morgan
down
as
best
he
could
and
took
him
again
through
the
events
of
the
week
before
his
daughter
vanished
.
No
,
he
had
n't
seen
her
for
a
week
before
that
weekend
;
he
had
missed
her
-
this
with
a
baleful
glance
towards
the
door
-
and
had
indeed
got
as
far
as
ringing
her
up
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
hoping
she
would
come
up
for
Sunday
,
but
had
got
no
answer
from
her
flat
.
"
It
was
n't
worth
going
down
on
the
off-chance
,
or
so
I
thought
.
But
perhaps
if
I
had
-
"
"
You
were
close
to
your
daughter
,
then
?
"
McLeish
asked
hopefully
.
"
Yes
.
We
were
like
each
other
;
she
knew
what
she
wanted
and
she
did
n't
mess
around
.
I
ca
n't
bear
people
who
do
n't
know
what
they
want
and
dither
.
"
"
So
you
were
pleased
that
she
was
marrying
?
"
"
Not
particularly
.
"
McLeish
did
not
manage
to
conceal
surprise
and
Francis
Morgan
looked
at
him
wretchedly
,
the
restless
brown
eyes
wide-set
,
like
the
dead
girl
's
,
and
very
bright
.
"
He
's
all
right
,
I
suppose
,
Giles
-
for
a
politician
.
But
he
thinks
he
's
the
centre
of
the
world
and
he
was
going
to
make
it
difficult
for
Angie
to
do
what
she
wanted
if
it
would
affect
his
career
.
He
likes
all
that
,
the
cars
and
people
calling
him
Minister
,
but
he
wanted
her
to
be
the
good
politician
's
wife
,
doing
his
entertaining
.
He
did
n't
say
so
,
mind
,
but
I
told
Angie
she
would
have
to
watch
it
after
she
married
him
.
And
he
wanted
her
money
,
of
course
.
These
chaps
do
n't
have
security
of
tenure
.
"
McLeish
reflected
that
Giles
Hawick
was
the
classic
example
of
someone
who
knew
what
they
wanted
and
did
n't
mess
around
,
and
that
that
was
what
had
attracted
Francis
Morgan
's
daughter
.
Perhaps
he
had
not
said
to
himself
that
in
a
marriage
between
two
like
this
,
someone
was
going
to
have
to
know
a
little
less
clearly
what
they
had
wanted
.
"
Was
there
someone
else
around
you
would
rather
she
had
married
?
"
he
asked
bluntly
,
deciding
it
was
that
sort
of
conversation
.
"
No
one
in
particular
,
but
I
thought
she
'd
have
been
better
off
with
a
chap
of
her
own
age
who
would
have
wanted
her
to
carry
on
where
she
was
.
Someone
who
would
have
known
she
was
exceptional
and
have
encouraged
her
.
"
And
been
less
of
a
direct
rival
to
her
Dad
,
and
all
,
McLeish
thought
,
and
stuck
to
his
line
.
"
And
there
was
no
one
like
that
in
her
life
?
"
Francis
Morgan
,
calmer
now
,
visibly
bent
his
mind
to
the
question
.
"
She
had
dozens
of
boyfriends
,
"
he
said
,
wistfully
.
"
I
probably
met
them
all
.
But
they
did
n't
seem
to
last
very
long
.
She
did
n't
want
to
settle
down
,
you
see
,
and
they
all
wanted
her
to
.
"
McLeish
decided
he
was
not
going
to
get
much
more
out
of
this
and
went
on
to
check
,
gently
,
what
Francis
Morgan
had
done
with
the
weekend
.
He
appeared
to
have
spent
it
blamelessly
playing
golf
,
dining
with
neighbours
and
at
home
doing
some
work
.
He
would
check
it
,
if
he
needed
to
,
but
he
could
not
at
the
moment
see
why
Morgan
would
have
wanted
to
kill
the
daughter
to
whom
he
had
plainly
been
so
devoted
.
He
managed
to
have
another
few
words
with
Mrs
Morgan
also
,
who
was
looking
much
stronger
.
She
apologized
obliquely
for
her
husband
,
and
McLeish
murmured
that
Mr
Morgan
had
obviously
been
very
much
attached
to
Angela
.
"
So
was
I
,
Chief
Inspector
,
"
Sarah
Morgan
said
evenly
.
"
And
I
was
glad
she
was
marrying
an
older
man
like
Giles
Hawick
.
"
The
emphasis
on
the
"
I
"
was
faint
but
definite
and
McLeish
carried
the
echo
away
in
his
head
.
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
sound
ungrateful
,
but
I
'm
starving
,
"
Catherine
said
,
as
they
reached
the
gate
.
"
Can
you
wait
till
London
?
There
's

good
place

Ealing

them

you
want
.
"
She
slept
deeply
while
they
were
on
the
motorway
,
but
woke
as
he
came
into
London
and
had
to
stop
and
start
in
the
heavy
evening
traffic
.
"
Better
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
at
him
.
"
Dinner

s
not
far

"
Restored
by
a
large
steak
,
he
explained
to
her
as
they
ate
that
he
liked
to
work
very
quickly
on
a
murder
case
,
pushing
everyone
to
get
an
answer
.
"

do
more
cases

"
"
I
've
been
a

lucky

he
said
,
modestly
.
"
I

up
most

them

she
observed
with
privileged
acerbity
and
he
laughed
,
embarrassed
as
every
policeman
had
been
by
the
revelations
just
made
of
Thames
Valley
's
modus
operandi
.
"
Eight
cases
withdrawn
so
far
,
is
n't
it
?
"
Catherine
asked
.
"
And
more
to
come
.
"
He
smiled
at
her
,
thinking
what
a
treat
it
was
to
talk
shop
with
someone
as
beautiful
and
intelligent
as
this
.
She
insisted
quietly
on
halving
the
bill
and
he
let
her
have
her
way
,
not
wanting
to
jeopardize
his
chance
of
eating
with
her
in
the
future
.
He
glanced
up
as
they
completed
this
transaction
to
find
the
attention
of
the
nearest
two
tables
,
both
exclusively
male
,
fixed
disbelievingly
on
them
.
As
three
men
slowly
looked
away
McLeish
received
the
uncompromising
message
that
if
any
of
them
had
been
so
lucky
as
to
have
dinner
with
Catherine
Crane
,
none
of
them
would
have
let
her
pay
for
herself
.
Indeed
he
had
a
strong
feeling
that
only
his
six
foot
four
inches
prevented
one
of
them
from
saying
so
.
He
glanced
at
Catherine
but
she
had
obviously
noticed
nothing
out
of
the
way
.
Outside
the
restaurant
McLeish
hesitated
,
not
wanting
the
evening
to
end
.
"
A
drink
?
"
he
suggested
,
hopefully
,
but
Catherine
shook
her
head
.
"
My
flat
is
in
almost
as
much
of
a
mess
as
the
office
.
I
was
in
a
chain
,
and
I
only
managed
to
complete
last
week
.
I
'd
better
go
and
get
it
straight
.
I
have
n't
even
got
the
curtains
hung
,
or
unpacked
the
kitchen
stuff
.
"
"
Let
me
come
and
help
?
"
McLeish
offered
,
cheerfully
.
"
It
is
the
fault
of
C1
that
you
do
n't
have
today
or
tomorrow
to
get
straight
.
I
'll
come
and
put
in
a
couple
of
hours
,

you
can
get
a
bit
more
comfortable

"
She
hesitated
,
then
said
that
she
would
like
that
rather
than
a
drink
,
if
he
really
would
n't
mind
.
The
flat
was
indeed
in
some
disarray
:
immaculately
clean
,
evidently
she
had
done
that
first
,
but
with
most
of
its
furnishings
disposed
in
boxes
on
the
floor
.
McLeish
,
naturally
efficient
and
brought
up
by
a
mother
with
firm
views
on
men
's
participation
in
the
drearier
household
chores
,
took
just
over
an
hour
to
sort
her
kitchen
to
her
satisfaction
while
she
got
the
living-room
straight
,
with
all
the
books
unpacked
.
"
That
's
marvellous

much

Then
I
'll
be
off

you
can
catch
up

yourself

"
They
fell
comfortably
into
gossip
about
various
parts
of
their
experience
until
McLeish
noticed
she
was
looking
tired
.
"
I
'm
off

he
said
,
briskly
.
"

She
thanked
him
demurely
,
and
he
realized
she
was
laughing
at
him
.
He
looked
down
at
her
,
about
to
kiss
her
good-night
as
if
she
were
one
of
Francesca
's
friends

pulled
himself
up

well

Davidson

he
told
himself

got
himself
out
of
the
door
on
this
thought
.
The
telephone
was
ringing
as
McLeish
walked
into
his
own
flat
,

he
picked
it
up
to
find
his
Commander

the

the
line

raised
his
eyebrows

taken
aback
by
the
transparency
of
his
superior
's
line
of

primly
gave

McLeish
,
shaking
his
head

rang
Catherine
and
broke
it
to
her
apologetically
that

would

required
for

afternoon

"
"
Probably
not
,
"
McLeish
conceded
.
He
went
to
bed
to
dream
uneasily
,
and
woke
early
as
he
always
did
in
the
early
stages
of
a
case
before
he
had
got
the
machine
working
properly
.
At
tea-ti
me
the
next
day
he
picked
up
Catherine
at
her
flat
,
noticing
that
she
was
looking
rested
and
pretty
even
if
he
was
feeling
jaded
and
disaffected
.
They
were
received
in
the
Minister
's
private
flat
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
close
to
the
House
of
Commons
.
McLeish
remembered
that
this
man
's
constituency
was
in
Derbyshire
.
They
took
a
tiny
,
cramped
lift
to
the
top
floor
of
the
building
and
were
admitted
by
Hawick
,
who
was
wearing

masculine

dominated
the

his

was
grim-faced

he
offered

Hawick

a
big

the
fireplace

a
simulated
coal
fire
burned
merrily

it

I

We

McLeish

not

mean
this
administration

must
mean
one
of
the
same
political
persuasion
.
Measures
passed
by
those
of
a
different
political
hue

described
as
the
work
of

.
A
good

in

McLeish

its
high
ceiling

the
Sunday
quiet

London

"
Indeed
.
"
Well
,
it
was
interesting
,
McLeish
thought
gravely
,
making
an
unnecessary
note
,
that
Giles
Hawick
had
admitted
unprompted
to
the
local
knowledge
necessary
for
disposing
of
Angela
Morgan
's
body
in
that
particular
place
.
But
it
had
been
the
older
sister
he
had
gone
there
with
,
and
had
apparently
abandoned
in
favour
of
the
younger
,
more
exciting
girl
.
He
decided
he
was
n't
going
to
get
anywhere
along
those
lines
,
or
not
yet
,
and
went
over
again
the
details
of
when
Hawick
had
last
seen
his
fiancee
.
He
found
his
account
,
as
he
would
have
expected
,
consistent
,
and
considered
the
man
carefully
as
he
did
so
.
For
all
his
ambition
,
Hawick
was
obviously
a
man
of
strong
passions
and
,
for
McLeish
's
money
,
well
capable
of
murder
.
There
was
,
however
,
no
apparent
motive
,
McLeish
reminded
himself
,
and
he
must
not
let
his
own
uneasy
conviction
that
Angela
Morgan
would
have
been
more
than
capable
of
stirring
up
strong
and
complex
emotions
in
those
around
her
cloud
his
judgement
.
Time
to
ask
the
obvious
question
.
"
We
're
at
a
very
early
stage
in
all
this
,
Minister
,
but
can
you
think
of
anyone
who
would
have
wanted
to
harm
Miss
Morgan

"
"
Yes
.
"
McLeish
blinked
at
him
,
startled
.
"
Yes
,
I
can
think
of
one
or
two
people
who
might
have
wanted
to
harm
her
,
as
you
suggest
.
None
who
might
have
carried
that
wish
to
the
length
of
killing
her
.
I
take
it
her
death
can
not
have
been
accidental
?
"
"
Probably
not
,
"
McLeish
agreed
,
thinking
of
the
misshapen
skull
.
"
Who
had
reason
to
wish
her
ill
,
then
?
"
"
She
was
left
a
large
legacy
by
an
ex-employer
.
His
niece
,
who
is
a
little
unbalanced
,
took
this
very
badly
,
despite
the
fact
she
herself
was
a
substantial
legatee
.
She
certainly
made
threats
against
Angela
and
has
bothered
her
recently
.
This
is
a
woman
called
Penelope
Huntley
.
I
've
never
spoken
to
her
myself

I
know
Angela
had
found
it
necessary
to

Indeed
she
did

both
made
new
wills
last
week

each
left
the
bulk

the
other

a
couple
of
minor
legacies

looked
suddenly
tired

old

lines

intensified

were

professional
jealousies
in

life

too
,
"
he
said
,
wearily
,
rubbing
the
patch
between
his
eyebrows
in
a
gesture
McLeish
recognized
from
his
television
appearances
.
"
You

she
could
have
run
into
trouble

he
asked
,
cautiously
.
"
I
hope
not

I
must
say
I
was
not
totally
happy
about
her
going
on
at
Yeo
Davis
,
with
me
in
the
government
.
But
she
was
very
reluctant
to
give
it
up
and
there
is
a
precedent
.
One
of
my
Ministerial
colleagues
is
married
to
a
partner
in
a
firm
specializing
in
financial
public
relations
where
there
are
similar
possibilities
for
conflict
of
interest
.
"
But
maybe
your
Ministerial
colleague
is
n't
going
right
for
the
very
top
,
McLeish
thought
with
unreasonable
conviction
,
and
you
were
going
to
stop
her
working
at
Yeo
Davis
when
you
could
.
He
glanced
up
and
found
the
cool
blue
eyes
on
him
.
"
That
being
said
,
anyone
will
tell
you
that
a
Minister
of
the
Crown
needs
a
wife
capable
of
supporting
him
.
It
's
one
of
those
jobs
where
the
pay
does
n't
actually
cover
the
cost
of
the
lifestyle
,
and
you
can
be
out
on
you
one
day
and
the
next
.
But
I
think
we
would
have
tried
to
find
her
a
job
rather
more
removed
from
mine
,
over
time
.
"
A
very
fair
admission
,
McLeish
thought
admiringly
,
and
made
his
standard
speech
about
the
need
,
if
he
might

come
back
on
various
points

him

the
man

nightmare

realized
he
could
give
only
qualified
reassurance

sunny
day

the
brilliant
February
sun

There
was
real

man
had
decided

relegate
Catherine
Crane
to
fourth
place
in
his
scheme
of
things

In

windy
,
cold
field
in
Cambridgeshire

green
with
winter
wheat
,
half
a
mile
away
from

body
had
been

small
man
with
a
narrow

sat
smoking
his
twentieth
cigarette
of
the
day
at
the
wheel

He
arrived
at
a
decision
,
threw
the
cigarette
away
,
and
turned
towards
a
small
depressing
row
of
agricultural
cottages

emerged
two
minutes
later
with
a
bulky
small
man

the

Rover
turned
on
to
the
Cambridge
road

making
for
the
headquarters

regional
crime

as
the
Cambridgeshire
sergeant
explained
that
the
keeper
on
the
shooting
estate
had
realized
he
had
seen
the
old
plough
there
last
week
and
had
fetched
the
farmer
in
to
explain
where
it
had
gone
.
"
He
says
he
never
saw
a
body
when
he
moved
it
.
He
was
very
unhappy
at
having
to
come
out
at
all
,
but
I
think
he
"
s
just
pig-ignorant
rather
than
involved
.
Do
you
want
me
to
send
someone
to
look
at
the
plough
?
"
"
Have
you
seen
it

I
'll
go

I
must

we
have
n't
got
any
forensic
people
here

being
Sunday

can
get
them
out

us
a

The
sergeant
at
the
other
end
said
grimly
that
the
bloke
was
quite
thick
enough
to
do
just
that

precautions

be
taken

'll
have
a

there

"
John
McLeish
was
feeling
justifiably
pleased
with
himself
as
he
walked
into
his
office
at
eight
o'clock
on
Monday
morning
.
He
had
devoted
Sunday
evening
to
making
a
plan
of
action
and
knew
exactly
what
he
and
everyone
else
he
could
press
into
service
was
going
to
be
doing
this
morning
.
His
schedule
for
the
day
was
organized
,
thanks
to
some
brisk
telephoning
the
night
before
,
and
he
would
have
Catherine
Crane
at
his
side
all
day
,
and
all
the
days
until
this
case
finished
.
He
arrived
at
his
desk
,
squinted
at
the
offering
tucked
into
his
blotter
and
sat
down
to
read
it
properly
:
a
short
,
sanctimonious
newspaper
piece
on
the
temptation
and
pressures
on
the
successful
young
,
Tristram
Wilson
being
mentioned
,
with
many
a
crocodile
tear
,
as
one
of
the
recent
casualties
.
It
was
presumably
Bruce
Davidson
,
who
admired
and
was
annoyed
by
Francesca
in
about
equal
measure
,
and
therefore
took
an
unremitting
interest
in
all
her
activities
,
who
had
favoured
him
with
this
.
McLeish
threw
it
away
and
methodically
sorted
his
notes
;
he
was
not
going
near
a
top
firm
of
solicitors
without
a
very
careful
list
of
questions
,
and
his
first
port
of
call
that
morning
was
to
be
Huttons
,
who
had
been
Angela
Morgan
's
solicitors
.
He
and
Catherine
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
Mr
Timothy
Hutton
,
who
was
housed
in
outwardly
featureless
modern
offices
in
one
of
the
little
streets
off
Ludgate
Hill
.
The
view
from
the
window
featured
a
building
site
and
a
large
collection
of
assorted
earth-moving
machinery
and
cranes
,
all
displayed
simultaneously
.
Even
through
double
glazing
there
was
a
dull
,
continuous
background
noise
,
and
the
huge
modern
windows
were
dusty
in
the
February
sun
.
The
furniture
and
fittings
were
ruthlessly
modern
,
several
steps
beyond
the
conventional
Scandinavian
.
Mr
Hutton
's
desk
was
a
shaped
piece
of
black
wood
with
a
single
file
on
it
,
and
the
heavily
bound
books
that
covered
one
wall
appeared
to
be
held
there
by
the
power
of
faith
,
no
shelves
being
visible
.
The
owner
was
also
uncompromisingly
twentieth-century
,
a
man
of
much
the
same
height
and
age
as
McLeish
but
built
like
a
string
bean
,
with
brown
,
short-cut
hair
and
fashionable
heavy
horn-rimmed
spectacles
.
He
greeted
them
briskly
and
folded
himself
into
a
chair
.
McLeish
noted
enviously
that
Mr
Hutton
was
a
vision
of
elegance
in
one
of
this
year
's
broadly
striped
blue
and
white
shirts
:
he
had
tried
one
on
himself
recently
,
and
had
been
forced
reluctantly
to
the
conclusion
that
he
looked
like
a
bouncer
for
an
East
End
club
.
"
Dreadful
thing
about
Miss
Morgan
,
"
Timothy
Hutton
said
earnestly
.
"
We
were
all
very
shocked
-
I
told
my
partners
at
prayers
this
morning
.
Sorry
,
that
's
what
we
call
the
Monday
morning
meeting
where
we
discuss
what
's
going
on
.
How
can
I
help
you
?
"
"
You
can
tell
us
,
please
,
what
Miss
Morgan
's
property
was
and
how
her
will
distributes
it
.
I
understand
that
you
are
her
executor
.
"
"
I
am
,
yes
.
With
her
father
.
I
've
just
looked
it
up
.
I
did
n't
,
of
course
,
expect
to
have
to
-
not
quite
so
soon
.
"
He
opened
the
file
and
considered
it
,
unhurriedly
and
unselfconsciously
,
and
McLeish
had
a
sudden
vision
of
an
older
Mr
Hutton
in
a
tail-coat
and
wing
collar
behind
this
modern
facade
.
"
We
have
two
wills
on
file
,
"
Timothy
Hutton
said
,
reaching
the
end
of
whatever
internal
debate
he
had
been
having
,
"
but
the
second
,
which
was
made
in
anticipation
of
her
marriage
to
Mr
Hawick
,
can
not
of
course
be
submitted
for
Probate
since
that
marriage
did
not
take
place
.
So
it
's
the
first
will
she
made
-
what
?
-
eighteen
months
ago
,
which
is
valid
.
"
McLeish
said
promptly
that
he
would
need
to
know
the
contents
of
both
wills
as
well
as
details
of
Miss
Morgan
's
estate
,
and
Timothy
Hutton
considered
him
carefully
.
"
Yes
,
I
see
you
do
,
"
he
agreed
,
"
and
I
'm
not
here
to
make
difficulties
.
Look
,
I
need
to
explain
a
bit
of
background
.
Angela
was
very
comfortably
off
.
Just
over
two
years
ago
she
benefited
very
considerably
from
the
will
of
a
chap
called
William
Coombes
,
who
was
senior
partner
in
one
of
the
second-rank
stockbrokers
.
They
do
all
right
,
those
chaps
,
even
after
taxes
.
She
got
about
two
hundred
thousand
and
a
life
interest
in
another
two
hundred
thou
.
The
family
wanted
to
dispute
the
will
,
and
that
's
when
Angela
-
Miss
Morgan
-
came
to
us
for
advice
.
Well
,
Coombes
was
only
sixty-two
when
he
died
-
it
was
a
heart
attack
,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
brains
.
The
family
did
n't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
and
so
I
advised
.
They
caved
in
;
I
mean
it
was
only
a
sister
and
a
niece
,
and
they
'd
both
been
provided
for
during
his
lifetime
and
the
niece
got
a
couple
of
hundred
thou
in
his
will
.
But
the
niece
was
very
bitter
about
it
-
I
had
to
write
a
letter
to
her
solicitors
a
year
or
so
later
because
she
'd
been
bothering
Angela
long
after
the
estate
was
settled
.
"
McLeish
thought
his
way
through
this
one
,
drawing
a
diagram
on
the
edge
of
his
notes
.
"
Miss
Morgan
got
some
of
it
just
for
life
?
Who
gets
it
now
,
then
?
"
"
The
niece
,
the
one
I
've
been
telling
you
about

Penelope
Huntley
.
I
can
give
you
the
address
of
her
solicitors
-
Kenwards
,
two-partner
firm
in
Kensington
.
I
'll
look
for
it
.
Go
on
asking
me
things
.
"
"
How
old
is
Miss
Huntley
?
"
"
Same
age
as
Angela
.
I
agree
,
she
would
not
normally
have
expected
the
remainder
to
fall
in
and
be
useful
to
her
,
but
of
course
if
she
had
had
children
,
it
would
have
been
valuable
to
them
.
"
"
But
if
you
were
Penelope
Huntley
you
might
not
have
been
consoled
by
the
thought
that
your
children
would
inherit
after
Miss
Morgan
's
death
.
"
"
No
,
I
would
n't
.
Nor
was
she
.
"
"
Sorry
?
"
"
That
's
what
she
kept
writing
to
Angela
about
.
Her
lawyer
had
advised
her
that
she
could
,
by
agreement
with
Angela
,
break
the
trust
.
They
're
both
-
were
both
-
well
over
twenty-one
,
and
they
could
have
made
a
deal
which
essentially
bought
out
Angela
's
life
interest
for
a
capital
sum
and
then
Miss
Huntley
would
have
got
the
rest
.
"
McLeish
thought
that
it
seemed
a
reasonably
sensible
plan
.
"
Is
that
very
difficult
to
do
?
"
he
asked
,
cautiously
.
"
No
.
It
's
a
routine
valuation
exercise
based
on
actuarial
tables
.
I
do
n't
think
it
would
have
done
Miss
Huntley
a
lot
of
good
financially
though
,
given
that
Angela
was
only
twenty-nine
and
actuarially
good
for
another
forty
years
.
"
McLeish
considered
him
with
pleasure
.
His
last
interview
with
a
solicitor
had
been
conducted
in
a
language
barely
recognizable
as
English
and
it
had
taken
over
three
hours
and
a
reference
to
the
Chief
Constable
to
elicit
the
fact
that
the
deceased
had
made
a
previous
will
in
which
the
respective
positions
of
his
wife
and
his
mistress
had
been
exactly
reversed
.
As
McLeish
had
observed
to
a
colleague
at
the
ti
me
,
he
'd
have
understood
the
whole
performance
if
the
solicitor
in
question
had
been
going
to
marry
either
of
them
,
but
there
had
been
no
question
of
that
,
it
was
just
obfuscation
for
its
own
sake
.
He
decided
,
to
make
sure
he
had
this
clear
.
"
So
Miss
Morgan
would
have
got
the
lion
's
share
of
the
other
two
hundred
thousand
even
if
she
had
agreed
to
break
up
the
trust
?
Yes
?
Then
why
did
she
not
agree
to
it
?
Or
was
she
going
to
?
"
Timothy
Hutton
stopped
hunting
in
the
file
.
He
spread
both
hands
on
the
table
in
an
aid
to
thought
and
McLeish
noticed
how
long
the
fingers
were
.
"
Sorry
.
She
would
n't
do
it
at
the
time
,
because
she
felt
the
whole
issue
ought
to
be
allowed
to
settle
down
.
It
was
very
difficult
,
you
know
-
Miss
Huntley
was
bitter
and
there
was
an
extremely
unpleasant
scene
in
Kenwards
's
offices
.
The
partner
there
was
terribly
embarrassed
,
rang
me
up
and
apologized
for
hours
afterwards
,
could
n't
get
him
off
the
phone
.
So
Angela
did
n't
want
to
get
involved
-
she
did
n't
need
the
capital
,
after
all
-
and
she
said
to
me
she
might
do
it
in
a
year
or
so
when
Miss
Huntley
had
calmed
down
.
"
He
gazed
at
his
hands
,
and
visibly
played
this
back
to
himself
,
then
looked
across
at
McLeish
,
and
put
his
glasses
on
.
"
Look
,
I
'm
not
saying
Angela
actually
refused
.
Sorry
,
I
can
hear
how
it
sounds

She
said
-

rather
I
did
,
to
her
solicitors
-
that
she
would
consider
it
again
in
a
year

so

everyone
was
calmer

"
McLeish
flipped
back
through
his
notes
.
Catherine
was
so
quiet
that
she
might
as
well
not
have
been
in
the
room
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
must
train
her
to
make
some
unobtrusive
signal
to
him
when
she
thought
he
was
missing
something

reached
his

him

He
looked
at
her
carefully
to
see
he
had
made
himself
clear
,
then
resumed
his
search
through
the

have

£100,000
outright

her
sister

Timothy

nodded

took
his

off

McLeish
realized
that
he
did

He
passed
it
over
the
table
,
and
courteously
got
up
to
give
Catherine
a
second
copy

The
problem
item
appeared
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
,
in
what
McLeish
decided
was
characteristic
legal
style
-
you
did
n't
hide
it
,
you
just
put
it
last
,
after
the
long
respectable
list
of
£20,000
ICI
loan
stock
,
and
7,000
25p
shares
in
Sainsbury
.
"
This
is
a
loan

£100,000

Yeo
Davis

"
Well
,
it

the
amount
she
was
asked
to
put
up
when
she
became
a
partner
last
year
.
"
"
Is
that
usual
?
"
"
Difficult
to
say
.
"
Timothy
Hutton
was
looking
uncomfortable
and
McLeish
said
that
it
just
seemed
a
lot
to
him
.
"
I
mean
,
I
imagine
a
lot
of
people
might
have
difficulty
raising
that
much
?
"
"
Yes
and
no
.
She
drew
something
like
£30,000
from
the
partnership
last
year
.
People
can
borrow
on
that
.
But
I
did
think
it
was
a
lot
,
and
I
tell
you
why
:
I
ca
n't
really
see
what
a
group
of
professionals
charging
fees
like
that
needs
cash
for
.
When
we
started
here
we
only
put
in
about
£100,000
between
four
of
us
,
to
keep
us
going
till
the
fees
came
in
,
and
that
was
more
than
enough
.
And
Yeo
Davis
charge
a
good
deal
more
than
we
do
,
I
can
tell
you
.
In
some
sense
Angela
may
have
been
paying
for
the
assets
-
they
had
assets
valued
at
£600,000
then
,
most
of
it
in
the
lease
on
the
building
.
But
you
usually
deal
with
that
by
giving
new
partners
uneven
shares
.
Say
the
profits
come
out
at
£500,000
,
then
senior
partner
gets
£200,000
,
second
partner
£100,000
and
so
on
.
It
's
not
usual
to
make
new
partners
put
up
a
lot
of
cash
.
"
McLeish
contemplated
this
and
decided
he
would
have
to
find
out
more
about
Yeo
Davis
's
financial
affairs
.
"
What
happens
to
that
loan
now
?
"
It
was
Catherine
again
and
McLeish
was
mildly
irritated
by
the
way
she
seemed
to
be
ahead
of
him
.
"
I
'm
looking
at
the
partnership
agreement
now
-
trm
,
trm
,
trm
,
here
we
are
-
death
in
partnership
-
well
,
it
dissolves
the
partnership
,
course
it
does
,
but
what
happens
to
the
money
?
Ah
yes
,
the
partnership
has
a
year
to
give
it
back
.
I
remember
saying
this
was
a
bit
leisurely
,
was
n't
it
,
but
there
was
some
apparently
reasonable
explanation
,
like
no
one
gave
any
notice
that
they
were
going
to
die
and
the
partnership
could
be
a
bit
pushed
to
produce
the
cash
if
it
was
the
wrong
time
of
year
.
And
of
course
none
of
us
were
particularly
exercised
about
death
as
a
real
possibility
.
As
executor
,
I
'll
ask
for
it
back
formally
,
but
I
wo
n't
hold
my
breath
.
It
's
interest-free
,
so
I
'd
expect
to
get
it
in
eleven
months
and
twenty-nine
days
from
giving
notice
.
"
The
phone
rang
and
Hutton
picked
it
up
,
glancing
at
his
watch
.
"
Yes

He
looked
enquiringly
at
McLeish
.
"
Fine
.
"
He
banged
the
phone
down
briskly
and
sat
,
clearly
working
out
what
else
he
could
offer
to
get
them
to
go
.
Amused
,
McLeish
said
that
he
would
be
happy
to
wait
in
an
outer
office
for
copies
of
the
various
documents
,
or
to
have
them
sent
on
.
"
What
would
happen
if
anyone
just
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
partnership
-
I

,
without
a
death
being
involved
?
"
McLeish
asked
,
as
they
stood
up
.
"
Six
months
'
notice
,
both
ways

any

within
that
period

Pretty
much
a
standard
period
.
Lots
of
provisions
against
stealing
clients
subsequently
,
of
course
.
"
As
Timothy
Hutton
's
attention
was
openly
on
whatever
his
next
problem
was
,
McLeish
decided
to
leave
,
and
to
extract
anything
else
he
needed
from
the
documents
.
He
did
now
at
least
know
roughly
what
was
in
them
.
In
the
event
,
they
went
back
to
Scotland
Yard
so
that
McLeish
could
get
to
a
phone
and
check
with
his
secretary
,
and
with
Bruce
Davidson
,
who
was
co-ordinating
the
evidence
as
it
came
in
.
"
Forensic

Bruce
reported
dourly

report

on
its

rubbish
about

He
wanted
to
speak
to
you
but
I
said
you
had
a
string
of
interviews

he
coughed
up
to
me

bang
on
the
head
from

,
massive
bleeding
inside
the
brain

Small
contusion
on
the
right
cheek
as
well

He
went
on
a
while
about
the
various
tests
but
where
he
came
out
was
that
she
'd
been
dead
for
at

five
days

seven

perfectly
possible

McLeish
silently
agreed
with
that
judgement
.
That
left
at
least
forty-eight
hours
from
Angela
Morgan
's
disappearance
when
,
as
far
as
the
forensic
evidence
went
,
she
could
have
been
alive
.
It
was
in
his
experience
difficult
for
most
people
to
prove
conclusively
exactly
where
they
had
been
for
any
forty-eight-hour
period
,
members
of
the
Metropolitan
police

always
excepted

this
was
going

make
his
life

difficult

McLeish
grunted
,
feeling
meanly
triumphant
that
he
had
turned
out
to
be
right
in
his
view
that
Francesca
would
not
be
able
to
sweep
Tristram
out
of
the
hands
of
the
New
York
police
in
quite
the
Napoleonic
way
she
had
assumed
.
And
he
had
been
perfectly
justified
,
he
assured
himself
smugly
,
in
cancelling
their
holiday
plans
at
once

she
had
never
been
going
to
get
back
on

Feeling
vindicated
and
far-seeing
,
he
strode
off
to
collect
Catherine
and
finish
his
coffee
.
Over
at

of
Trade

the
news

McLeish
was
considering
the
possible
relationship
between
design
and
organizational
style
when
Peter
Yeo
himself
came
down
to
fetch
them
.
"
Nice
to
meet
you
,
Chief
Inspector
,
"
he
said
with
automatic
politeness
,
then
considered
what
he
had
just
said
,
decided
it
was
beyond
explanation
and
led
them
upstairs
to
his
office
.
This
echoed
the
prevailing
Italian-restaurant
theme
,
except
for
the
large
comfortable
mahogany
desk
which
featured
reassuring
and
recognizable
objects
like
drawers
and
blotters
.
Peter
Yeo
himself
was
an
old-fashioned
and
recognizable
object
,
McLeish
thought
,
seeing
him
against
the
rapidly
fading
light
from
the
window
.
It
had
been
Bruce
Davidson
who
had
interviewed
Yeo
before
,
when
Angela
Morgan
had
still
been
officially
only
a
Missing
Person
and
Peter
Yeo
,
as
her
employer
,
one
of
the
obvious
people
to
talk
to
about
where
she
might
be
.
He
considered
him
as
he
caused
coffee
to
be
produced
and
established
them
at
the
big
table
at
the
other
end
of
his
room
.
Given
a
choice
,
you
would
have
taken
him
rather
than
Timothy
Hutton
for
a
solicitor
.
With
his
conventional
double-breasted
suit
,
carefully
cut
to
disguise
a
distinctly
stocky
figure
,
and
his
watchful
courtesy
he
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
Hutton
's
hard-edged
efficiency
.
The
difference
was
partly
generational
;
this
man
must
be
ten
years
older
than
Hutton
.
The
real
distinction
however
,
McLeish
thought
in
a
flash
of
revelation
,
lay
in
their
clients
'
expectations
.
Yeo
Davis
's
business
was
concerned
with
representing
people
who
did
not
know
the
ropes
,
or
even
that
there
were
any
ropes
;
Hutton
's
predominantly
with
fellow
professionals
in
other
fields
who
just
wanted
the
best
and
swiftest
way
through
.
So
Peter
Yeo
had
to
look
reassuring
and
solid
and
a
bit
older
,
while
Timothy
Hutton
could
probably
have
come
to
work
in
striped
organza
without
losing
a
single
client
.
He
abandoned
this
line
of
observation
and
looked
carefully
at
the
man
inside
the
suit
.
The
impression
of
suppressed
energy
which
he
had
received
as
he
arrived
was
intensified
;
Peter
Yeo
could
barely
sit
still
and
was
discharging
tension
by
moving
papers
on
his
desk
,
then
fiddling
with
the
Venetian
blinds
to
prevent
the
sun
from
shining
in
Catherine
's
eyes
.
The
bright
blue
eyes
looked
a
bit
bloodshot
,
and
there
was
a
flush
of
colour
across
the
cheekbones
.
Yeo
rubbed
the
back
of
his
neck
irritably
,
and
reached
for
his
coffee
,
downing
two
cups
while
McLeish
and
Catherine
Crane
were
still
passing
each
other
milk
and
sugar
.
A
thick
weekend
,
McLeish
decided
,
trying
to
think
how
best
to
establish
what
Yeo
's
relationship
had
been
with
the
dead
girl
.
He
started
,
as
he
had
intended
,
from
where
the
last
interview
had
left
off
and
went
quickly
over
the
ground
again
.
"

spending
the
night
with

a
bad
idea
,
Chief
Inspector
.
She
often
was
in
on
Saturday
.
We
own
the
building
and
all
the
partners
have
keys
,
so
unless
someone
else
was
here
she
could
have
been
in
and
out
without
anyone
noticing
.
"

I

You
left
at
what
time
?
"
"
Well
,
about
three
.
I
was
going
to
have
lunch
with
a
client
but
it
got
cancelled
,
so
I
just
stayed
here
.
There
's
a
kitchen
here
,
we
have
a
girl
who
comes
in
and
cooks
lunch
during
the
week
and
there
's
always
cheese
and
things
around
.
I
killed
a
rather
good
bottle
of
Fleurie
,
as
I
remember
it
.
I
went
to
the
flicks
-
I
wanted
to
see
Some
Like
It
Hot
for
about
the
tenth
time
and
it
was
being
revived
at
Baker
Street
.
I
knew
my
wife
did
n't
want
to
see
it
at
all
.
Then
I
came
back
here
to
change
,
before
I
joined
my
wife
at
a
dinner
party
.
Angie
was
n't
here
then
,
either
.
"
"
What
about
Sunday
?
Did
you
go
to
the
office
?
"
"
No
,
I
did
n't
.
We
spent
the
day
with
friends
.
"
That
left
a
large
space
of
time
on
Saturday
where
there
was
little
possibility
of
establishing
that
Peter
Yeo
had
been
where
he
said
he
was
.
But
the
man
himself
seemed
to
be
unconcerned
about
this
.
"
One
or
other
of
my
partners
is
usually
in
the
office
on
a
Saturday
.
It
happened
that
none
of
them
were
,
last
week
.
In
fact
it
's
so
regular
that
Fiona
-
that
's
the
girl
who
does
our
weekday
lunches
-
is
under
instructions
to
leave
something
we
can
eat
for
Saturday
lunch
.
"
"
Do
you
tell
her
how
many
are
likely
to
be
here
?
"
Catherine
had
decided
to
ask
a
question
.
Yeo
thought
about
it
.
"
Depends
-
I
mean
,
if
I
knew
I
had
a
team
coming
of
course
I
'd
tell
her
.
But
otherwise
I
just
reckon
there
will
be
something
around
-
or
if
the
locusts
have
been
at
the
fridge
,
well
,
I
can
always
go
out
.
"
"
Can
you
remember
what
you
ate
?
"
Peter
Yeo
considered
her
,
as
the
reason
for
her
question
sank
in
.
"
Actually
I
can
.
I
had
an
enormous
slice
of
quiche
that
was
left
over
from
Friday
.
I
felt
afterwards
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
make
such
an
effort
to
finish
it
all
.
Fiona
will
probably
remember
.
"
He
sounded
mildly
offended
but
not
in
the
slightest
bit
rattled
.
"
I
think
Some
Like
It
Hot
started
around
three-thirty
but
I
ca
n't
quite
remember
.
I
walked
down
-
it
's
not
far
,
and
I
was
feeling
rather
full
of
quiche
.
"
That
will
check
,
McLeish
thought
,
of
course
it
will
,
someone
just
has
to
do
it
all
.
That
means
at
some
stage
we
may
have
to
see
Mrs
Yeo
.
In
fact
,
he
decided
,
he
would
be
interested
to
see
a
wife
who
accepted
with
such
apparent
equanimity
her
husband
's
absence
on
a
Saturday
.
Presumably
,
however
,
the
senior
partner
in
Yeo
Davis
was
hardly
needed
to
do
the
odd
household
chore
.
Which
brought
him
to
consider
the
Yeo
Davis
partnership
;
how
did
it
work
?
How
important
to
it
had
Angela
Morgan
been
?
He
decided
to
start
as
softly
as
possible
.
"
Groups
like
yours
are
a
bit
outside
my
experience
,
"
he
confided
,
"
and
I
need
to
understand
a
bit
about
what
Miss
Morgan
did
for
a
living
.
Could
you
tell
me
,
perhaps
with
an
example
?
"
He
observed
from
the
way
peter
Yeo
gathered
himself
and
sat
up
straight
that
he
was
on
familiar
territory
,
and
understood
further
that
the
general
patter
was
well
rehearsed
.
It
was
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
a
great
deal
less
incisive
than
Francesca
's
summary
,
but
the
same
skeleton
was
recognizable
under
the
attractive
padding
placed
round
it
by
Peter
Yeo
.
Much
emphasis
was
put
on
the
importance
of
identifying
the
key
decision-takers
and
making
sure
that
they
had
the
right
information
-
much
was
made
of
the
necessity
of
their
getting
a
balanced
picture
on
which
to
take
their
decisions
.
"
Ours
is
not
unlike
the
job
of
a
good
barrister
,
"
Peter
Yeo
observed
,
reaching
a
peroration
.
"
We
try
to
make
sure
the
judge
has
all
the
facts
before
arriving
at
a
decision
.
Mostly
we
do
this
by
ensuring
that
our
client
gets
to
talk
to
the
decision-takers
.
There
is
no
point
at
all
in
my
talking
to
those
people
,
except
on
a
preliminary
basis
;
they
're
not
that
interested
in
my
views
.
I
do
the
background
briefing
but
the
clients
have
to
do
most
of
the
work
,
and
so
I
always
tell
them
.
"
McLeish
decided
this
was
good
stuff
from
which
,
but
for
Francesca
,
he
would
have
gained
no
clear
idea
of
what
a
firm
like
Yeo
's
was
really
for
.
"
So
you
would
,
for
instance
,
have
lunch
with
people
in
government
departments
to
talk
to
them
about
particular
policies
.
"
"
Yes
,
often
that
is
the
best
way
to
start
.
We
've
got
a
lot
of
friends
whom
we
can
talk
to
about
a
policy
generally
,
and
where
we
can
put
a
word
in
.
Let
me
try
and
think
of
an
example
that
is
n't
confidential
.
Yes
.
One
of
our
clients
is
Andy
Barton
,
who
runs
the
biggest
textile
group
in
the
north-west
.
Well
,
the
DTI
is
at
this
moment
considering
giving
money
to
keep
Huerter
,
one
of
his
main
rivals
,
going
.
A
Conservative
government
,
if
you
believe
their
manifesto
,
ought
not
even
to
be
considering
putting
money
into
dying
private-sector
firms
,
but
Huerter
employ
a
lot
of
people
,
many
of
whom
voted
for
this
government
.
One
of
the
last
things
Angela
did
was
to
have
lunch
with
an
old
schoolfriend
in
the
DTI
who
is
responsible
for
the
Huerter
case
,
to
make
sure
the
DTI
understood
the
impact
of
such
assistance
on
Barton
's
operations
.
"
"
And
did
it
?
"
McLeish
asked
.
"
Oh
yes
,
but
Angela
was
clear
that
the
civil
servants
were
going
nonetheless
to
recommend
assisting
Huerter
.
They
've
been
rescuing
companies
for
so
long
they
do
it
automatically
now
,
I
expect
.
So
that
told
us
that
we
had
better
get
a
full-scale
defence
working
immediately
.
"
McLeish
,
who
had
understood
from
Francesca
's
report
of
her
lunch
that
she
and
her
seniors
were
indeed
going
to
push
for
assistance
,
was
amused
to
hear
that
she
had
not
succeeded
in
disguising
her
intentions
from
Miss
Morgan
.
"
Can
you
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
advise
your
client
now
?
I
mean
,
what
is
a
full-scale
defence
?
"
"
Ah
,
well
it
varies
.
I
've
got
Andy
Barton
in
to
see
the
Minister
responsible
at
the
DTI
.
I
'm
keeping
the
Secretary
of
State
-
that
's
the
top
man
-
in
reserve
.
And
,
of
course
,
we
are
arranging
to
brief
Treasury
people
,
who
will
automatically
be
opposed
to
giving
away
public
money
;
and
we
are
working
with
the
company
on
a
memorandum
on
what
assistance
to
Huerter
would
do
to
Barton
,
with
a
two-page
bullet-point
summary
.
Politicians
do
n't
have
time
to
read
screeds
,
so
you
have
to
give
them
short
,
pithy
things
to
look
at
,
We
were
doing
all
this
anyway
,
of
course
,
but
the
chaps
at
Barton
,
including
Andy
,
are
working
on
it
much
more
effectively
since
we
were
able
to
say
definitely
that
the
DTI
civil
servants
were
agin
them
.
These
chaps
,
good
blokes
who
've
spent
all
their
lives
running
businesses
,
believed
the
government
manifesto
and
thought
that
if
they
shouted
loud
enough
in
the
local
paper
,
Whitehall
would
crumble
and
right
would
prevail
.
It
's
a
bit
more
difficult
than
that
.
"
That
lunch
had
,
in
fact
,
given
a
considerable
spur
to
a
campaign
being
waged
against
the
policy
Francesca
and
her
colleagues
wanted
,
McLeish
observed
.
The
point
of
Yeo
Davis
was
now
clear
:
they
were
there
to
inform
,
inspire
,
and
orchestrate
a
client
's
efforts
to
get
what
he
wanted
,
as
efficiently
as
possible
.
"
I
've
read
about
people
giving
MPs
expensive
lunches
,
"
he
said
,
with
interest
.
"
Waste
of
time
,
"
Peter
Yeo
said
briskly
.
"
The
good
ones
do
n't
have
time
for
long
drunken
lunches
,
and
you
get
better
results
by
getting
them
to
give
you
and
the
client
a
sandwich
in
a
bar
at
six
p.m
.
The
ones
you
can
get
for
lunch
-
there
are
plenty
-
will
likely
forget
every
word
you
tell
them
,
and
they
certainly
do
n't
feel
obliged
to
help
.
"
He
caught
McLeish
's
eye
.
"
Sorry
,
but
the
fact
is
the
average
backbench
MP
does
n't
know
anything
,
unlike
the
average
civil
servant
who
really
does
know
about
his
or
her
particular
area
.
It
's
only
worth
using
MPs
to
have
a
go
at
the
government
,
and
then
you
spoon-feed
it
to
them
.
"
The
man
had
come
to
life
very
considerably
in
discussing
his
job
and
a
formidable
personality
was
emerging
.
McLeish
decided
he
would
have
to
abandon
any
prejudice
taken
from
Francesca
about
this
trade
;
Peter
Yeo
knew
his
business
and
was
obviously
effective
.
And
it
was
a
good
thing
Yeo
Davis
existed
;
McLeish
himself
had
often
been
quietly
riled
by
the
intellectual
scorn
which
Francesca
and
her
colleagues
would
bring
to
bear
on
criticism
of
some
of
their
more
sweeping
policies
.
It
might
well
have
been
necessary
to
invent
Yeo
Davis
if
they
had
n't
already
existed
.
He
reminded
himself
that
he
was
talking
to
the
inventor
of
the
firm
and
decided
to
prod
a
bit
further
.
"
How
long

you

this
field

I
've
spent
all
my
life
in
general
PR
,

it
was
about
eight
years
ago
I
decided
that
there
was
room
for
a
specialist
agency
,
not
really
a
PR
firm
,
which
was
concerned
entirely

we

McLeish
glanced
at
the
clock
on
Yeo
's
desk
and
saw
that
he
was
running
behind
ti
me

tended
to
happen
at
this
stage
in
an
investigation
when
you
needed
to
be
in
six
places
at
once
.
He
considered
his
notes
;
what
he
needed
from
this
interview
was
to
confirm
that
Angela
Morgan
had
not
been
in
the
office
on
Saturday
,
and
a
statement
of
Peter
Yeo
's
movements
over
the
period
within
which
Angela
Morgan
had
probably
been
killed

He
also
did
need
to
understand
the
financial
side

of
thing
.
"
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
you
do
.
Well
,
you
understand
about
partnerships
,
do
you
?
None
of
the
partners
here
is
actually
entitled
to
a
salary
;
in
theory
we
split
the
profits
in
accordance
with
a
formula
that
we
fix
annually
and
that
takes
account
of
age
,
and
experience
and
what
people
are
contributing
in
terms
of
work
or
clients
.
As
a
matter
of
practice
,
and
because
we
've
all
got
to
live
,
we
all
draw
about
two-thirds
of
what
we
would
have
got
last
year
as
we
go
along
,
then
share
out
the
rest
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
"
McLeish
contemplated
this
system
and
its
possible
application
to
the
Metropolitan
police
force
and
felt
imagination
boggle
.
He
himself
would
have
been
desperately
pushed
if
he
had
had
to
manage
on
two-thirds
of
his
salary
until
Christmas
every
year
.
A
moment
's
thought
told
him
that
this
system
worked
only
because
two-thirds
of
the
expected
total
of
a
Yeo
Davis
partnership
came
out
at
an
amount
well
in
excess
of
his
salary
,
or
that
of
any
public
servant
of
his
age
.
He
asked
what
Angela
Morgan
had
been
drawing
on
every
month
and
found
his
belief
confirmed
.
Christmas
must
be
worth
having
at
Yeo
Davis
.
"
What
about
tax
?
"
he
asked
,
still
considering
the
mechanics
of
the
system
.
"
All
partners
are
technically
self-employed
but
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
getting
into
a
frightful
mess
we
deduct
a
percentage
from
their
drawings
,
so
there
is
something
put
aside
for
tax
.
I
'd
have
to
say
it
's
a
great
deal
lower
percentage
than
most
employed
people
pay
because
there
are
all
sorts
of
expenses
a
partnership
can
claim
.
If
we
seem
to
have
got
it
wrong
,
we
sort
it
out
when
we
divvy
up
the
profit
.
"
McLeish
made
a
conscientious
note
,
feeling
that
he
had
got
himself
sidetracked
off
the
more
interesting
question
of
Angela
Morgan
's
capital
investment
in
Yeo
Davis
.
Finding
no
way
other
than
the
direct
question
,
he
put
it
,
and
watched
Yeo
,
unruffled
,
confirm
that
she
had
indeed
put
up
£100,000
.
"
The
rest
of
us
had
put
up
much
the
same
,
given
that
we
had
done
it
earlier
,
"
he
assured
McLeish
.
"
It
seems
a
lot
,
but
we
have
employees
,
I
can
tell
you
,
below
partner
level
,
who
would
be
prepared
to
mortgage
their
children
to
get
a
partnership
here
.
And
Angela
did
n't
need
to
borrow
-
I
imagine
you
've
talked
to
her
solicitors
?
Well
then
,
you
know
that
she
was
pretty
well
placed
.
"
"
I
did
n't
know
that
a
business
like
this
needed
much
working
capital
?
"
McLeish
said
,
in
faithful
imitation
of
Timothy
Hutton
.
"
Oh
,
you
'd
be
surprised
.
We
live
off
fees
,
of
course
,
but
they
can
be
slow
coming
in
.
And
this
is
a
short
lease
here
-
we
have
to
provide
for
buying
something
or
paying
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
rent
.
No
,
that
sort
of
money
is
needed
,
believe
me
.
"
McLeish
,
who
had
a
built-in
prejudice
,
well
supported
by
experience
,
against
statements
incorporating
an
appeal
to
belief
,
noted
dourly
that
he
might
at
some
later
stage
need
to
get
closer
to
Yeo
Davis
's
accounts
.
That
could
wait
,
and
he
would
possibly
talk
to
Timothy
Hutton
again
first
.
He
wound
up
the
interview
and
was
rising
to
say
goodbye
when
Catherine
,
sounding
shy
,
asked
Peter
Yeo
if
she
could
possibly
use
their
ladies
'
room
.
"
Of
course
,
of
course
.
"
Peter
Yeo
was
obviously
delighted
to
do
any
service
,
however
modest
,
for
her
and
bustled
her
away
,
returning
belatedly
to
ask
McLeish
if
he
would
like
a
similar
facility
,
which
he
accepted
,
obedient
to
the
unwritten
CID
rule
that
you
looked
after
your
physical
needs
at
any
moment
that
opportunity
offered
,
because
you
never
knew
when
you
were
going
to
get
stuck
for
hours
without
help
.
He
waited
what
seemed
to
him
rather
an
excessive
ti
me
for
Catherine
,
but
decided
,
charitably
,
that
you
could
n't
look
as
she
did
without
pretty
regular
attention
to
the
overall
effect
.
They
were
in
the
car
,
preparing
to
drive
off
,
before
she
spoke
.
"
There
's
a
nice
little
flatlet
on
the
second
floor
.
Bathroom
,
bedroom
with
double
bed
,
kitchen
off

I
thought
there
might
be
.
"
He
looked
at
her
sideways
;
she
sounded
both
smug
and
irritated
.
"
You
think
it
's
misused
regularly
?
"
"
I
'd
put
money
on
it
.
"
The
response
was
so
swift
and
unhesitating
that
McLeish
was
taken
aback
,
and
drove
much
too
close
to
the
car
in
front
.
"
Sorry
.
You
thought
he
was
that
kind
of
bloke
?
"
She
was
silent
,
and
pink
across
the
cheekbones
-
and
McLeish
,
who
like
all
good
policemen
depended
heavily
on
intuition
,
understood
suddenly
that
experience
was
speaking
here
.
She
laughed
shortly
,
obviously
annoyed
with
herself
but
determined
to
make
her
point
.
"
Well
,
let's
say
that
I
've
heard
of
married
blokes
who
always
had
to
go
to
the
office
on
Saturdays
,
and
it
usually
was
n't
office
work
they
were
doing
.
It
sounds
all
right
,
and
if
the
wife
gets
suspicious
and
rings
up
,
well
he
's
there
,
is
n't
he
?
"
"
Not
so
good
if
the
wife
decides
to
drop
in
,
"
McLeish
offered
,
with
interest
.
"
Well
,
you
have
to
keep
the
office
door
locked
on
a
Saturday
,
do
n't
you
?
So
you
've
got
warning
,
"
she
said
dismissively
,
and
McLeish
let
himself
,
briefly
,
wonder
who
the
bloke
had
been
who
had
introduced
Catherine
to
this
experience
.
He
abandoned
speculation
firmly
and
concentrated
on
the
implications
for
the
present
case
,
since
he
was
plainly
being
offered
expert
testimony
.
"
Could
be
that
any
of
the
other
partners
used
it
?
"
he
suggested
.
"
The
place
is
n't
run
like
that
.
Mr
Yeo
is
the
boss
,
is
n't
he
?
"
So
she
too
had
observed
Yeo
's
imperial
command
of
the
partnership
.
"
No
,
I
agree
.
So
he
was
maybe
with
a
girl
on
that
Saturday
?
"
"
Maybe
.
I
was
wondering
about
him
and
Miss
Morgan
.
I
mean
,
he
likes
women
,
and
she
operated
by
sleeping
with
the
boss
.
"
McLeish
found
himself
shocked
by
this
piece
of
feminine
sharpness
and
must
have
registered
something
because
his
sergeant
blushed
.
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
like
it
sounds
-
she
did
n't
do
it
to
get
on
,
or
not
like
that
.
"
Her
hands
moved
,
in
frustration
as
she
tried
to
explain
.
"
I
think
she
might
have
done
it
as
a
quick
way
of
finding
out
how
the
business
worked
.
Because
she
was
obviously
both
clever
and
ambitious
.
"
"
Mm
.
"
McLeish
found
himself
receiving
this
with
reluctance
and
wondered
why
,
since
it
made
sense
.
He
glanced
at
her
,
being
taken
aback
to
find
her
looking
strained
and
as
near
plain
as
anyone
with
her
looks
was
going
to
.
Her
profile
was
very
sharp
against
the
gathering
darkness
.
"
What
is
it
,
love
?
"
he
asked
,
anxiously
,
falling
into
a
term
of
his
childhood
,
and
she
jumped
.
"
Sorry
,
I
'd
drifted
off
.
I
was
wondering
about
Peter
Yeo
.
Suppose
they
had
been
having
an
affair
,
and
she
'd
dropped
him
?
"
McLeish
considered
this
.
"
When
she
met
Giles
Hawick
?
"
"
Well
,
that
's
possible
,
is
n't
it
?
If
you
remember
,
Hawick
said
-
and
he
's
not
silly
-
that
there
was
someone
else
on
the
scene
when
he
first
asked
her
out
.
Perhaps
it
was
Mr
Yeo
?
And
she
decided
Hawick
was
the
better
bet
,
particularly
since
he
was
n't
married
.
"
McLeish
pondered
this
,
eyes
narrowed
,
driving
fast
but
carefully
.
"
Perhaps
there
is
n't
all
that
much
fun
in
going
around
with
a
married
bloke
,
after
all
?
"
"
She
could
still
have
wanted
him
but
got
tired
of
waiting
-
decided
he
was
n't
going
to
leave
his
wife
.
"
Catherine
was
sounding
tough
and
rational
,
but
something
in
her
voice
made
him
feel
this
whole
discussion
was
uncomfortable
for
her
.
He
sneaked
a
look
at
her
,
and
found
he
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
back
of
her
head
;
she
was
staring
out
of
the
passenger
window
at
the
darkening
vista
of
St
James
's
Park
.
He
looked
again
,
cautiously
,
and
saw
that
she
was
blindly
extracting
a
crumpled
paper
handkerchief
from
her
neat
navy
bag
.
He
waited
thirty
seconds
before
glancing
sideways
again
,
and
found
her
dabbing
at
her
face
,
trying
hard
not
to
sniff
.
He
flicked
up
the
left-hand
indicator
and
stopped
the
car
.
"
I
need
some
tea
and
I
've
got
a
thermos
here
,
"
he
announced
,
getting
out
of
the
car
without
looking
at
her
and
opening
the
back
door
on
his
side
to
find
the
thermos
which
he
had
filled
before
starting
off
.
He
got
the
top
off
and
a
cup
poured
before
lowering
himself
gingerly
back
into
the
driving
seat
and
passing
it
over
to
Catherine
.
Then
he
glanced
quickly
at
her
.
It
was
nearly
dark
outside
but
the
dashboard
lights
cast
a
faint
greenish
glow
.
She
was
still
sitting
with
her
head
partly
averted
,
so
her
face
was
hidden
.
He
poured
himself
a
cup
of
tea
and
drank
it
,
selfconsciously
,
very
aware
of
her
sitting
tensely
beside
him
.
"
Thank
you
,
John
.
That
was
nice
.
"
Catherine
sounded
suddenly
exhausted
,
and
as
she
gave
him
back
the
cup
she
turned
towards
him
,
letting
him
see
that
she
had
been
crying
,
but
without
looking
him
in
the
face
.
Looking
down
at
the
curve
of
her
cheekbone
,
still
wet
with
tears
,
he
suddenly
wanted
her
,
quite
overwhelmingly
.
He
sat
frozen
in
his
seat
by
surprise
,
so
blocked
by
his
own
consideration
of
duty
,
honour
and
the
right
way
to
behave
to
junior
staff
that
in
the
end
it
was
she
who
moved
towards
him
,
and
touched
his
cheek
.
He
slid
his
cheek
against
hers
and
,
moving
with
delicious
deliberate
slowness
,
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
.
The
sheer
pleasure
of
it
swept
him
up
and
it
was
a
full
minute
before
he
pulled
back
and
looked
at
her
,
amazed
at
how
happy
he
felt
.
"
Jesus
,
Catherine
.
Another
minute
and
I
'll
be
inviting
you
into
the
back
of
the
car
.
"
He
watched
her
smile
,
happy
and
comfortable
with
him
,
secure
in
the
pleasure
they
shared
.
"
If
you
like
,
or
we
could
go
back
to
my
flat
?
"
For
McLeish
the
rest
of
the
journey
had
the
quality
of
a
dream
.
With
one
part
of
his
mind
he
knew
he
was
getting
the
benefit
of
the
backlash
from
an
experience
in
Catherine
's
past
,
but
with
another
part
he
did
n't
care
about
any
of
that
,
there
was
no
reality
beyond
her
.
The
feeling
of
dream-like
ease
persisted
when
they
arrived
at
Catherine
's
flat
.
He
opened
the
car
door
for
her
,
hugged
her
as
she
got
out
,
and
they
went
up
to
her
flat
,
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
.
He
took
off
her
clothes
for
her
,
while
she
undid
as
many
of
his
buttons
as
she
could
,
and
after
that
it
was
pure
,
undiluted
,
uncomplicated
pleasure
until
they
fell
asleep
in
each
other
's
arms
.
Either
Bruce
Davidson
always
sounded
like
a
Speak
Your
Weight
machine
when
he
was
delivering
a
prepared
statement
,
or
the
answer-phone
stripped
all
character
from
People
's
voices
.
McLeish
had
rung
his
own
flat
to
collect
messages
;
he
could
see
Catherine
just
waking
,
and
waved
to
her
to
indicate
that
he
was
on
the
phone
.
He
realized
that
he
was
getting
cold
,
clad
as
he
was
exclusively
in
a
rather
small
towel
,
but
decided
to
stick
it
out
and
pick
up
all
of
Davidson
's
message
.
There
were
two
key
pieces
.
The
first
was
the
news
from
Cambridge
:
the
samples
of
blood
and
hair
collected
by
his
long-suffering
team
were
confirmed
as
a
match
to
the
dead
girl
's
.
The
indentation
in
her
skull
also
matched
.
She
had
either
fallen
or
been
pushed
on
to
a
spike
on
the
plough
;
the
level
of
her
blood
alcohol
gave
some
credence
to
the
idea
that
she
had
fallen
.
The
doctor
who
had
done
the
autopsy
,
however
,
had
scouted
,
promptly
,
any
suggestion
that
she
could
have
moved
thereafter
.
She
had
died
instantaneously
,
or
pretty
nearly
so
,
without
first
getting
up
and
crawling
down
the
embankment
,
or
for
that
matter
getting
up
and
riding
a
bicycle
.
Someone
had
thus
moved
the
body
,
and
it
had
to
be
assumed
that
it
was
the
same
person
who
had
pushed
her
on
to
the
plough
.
"
Doc
says
the
best
bet
,
given
the
mark
on
her
cheek
is
that
someone
slapped
her
one
and
she
fell
back
.
He
'll
put
it
in
writing
tomorrow
,
"
Davidson
summarized
succinctly
.
The
second
key
piece
of
information
was
that
Angela
Morgan
's
car
had
been
found
in
North
Kensington
,
not
far
from
her
flat
,
and
was
now
cordoned
off
and
being
crawled
over
inch
by
inch
by
a
forensic
team
hastily
dispatched
by
Davidson
.
Did
McLeish
want
to
come
and
see
it
,
in
situ
,
because
they
would
have
to
move
it
when
Forensic
had
finished
?
A
detailed
inventory
of
Bruce
's
day
followed
,
and
McLeish
understood
that
having
Catherine
Crane
working
on
this
case
had
rattled
Bruce
in
several
ways
.
Right
at
the
end
,
as
McLeish
's
teeth
were
starting
to
chatter
,
Davidson
confirmed
that
Penelope
Huntley
would
meet
him
at
eight
next
morning
and
he
hoped
that
that
was
n't
too
early
,
sorry
,
but
the
lass
had
been
difficult
to
tie
down
to
a
time
.
McLeish
glanced
again
at
his
watch
-
eleven-thirty
p.m
.
Just
as
well
someone
had
rung
Catherine
half
an
hour
ago
,
or
they
'd
both
still
have
been
asleep
,
and
he
would
have
had
difficult
questions
to
answer
in
the
morning
about
why
he
had
been
,
uncharacteristically
,
out
of
touch
with
everyone
since
leaving
Yeo
Davis
at
six
.
He
rang
Davidson
to
confirm
that
he
could
make
the
eight
a.
m.
appointment
.
"
We
have
a
date
at
eight
o'clock
,
"
he
said
redundantly
to
Catherine
.
"
I
heard
.
I
've
put
the
heating
on
.
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
bath
,
you
're
cold
?
"
"
I
"
d
like
that
.
They
've
found
her
car
,
too
-
I
'll
have
to
go
and
look
at
it
before
they
take
it
away
.
"
"
I
'll
come
with
you
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
Nothing
I
'd
like
better
.
But
they
're
all
going
to
wonder
why
I
dragged
you
along
at
this
time
of
night
.
I
mean
,
what
have
we
been
doing
?
"
Catherine
looked
downcast
,
and
McLeish
felt
uneasy
.
"
Sweet
,
it
's
you
I
'm
trying
to
protect
.
"
"
And
yourself
.
"
McLeish
acknowledged
the
point
promptly
.
"
Both
of
us
need
protecting
.
Old
Stevenson
would
go
spare
if
he
knew
,
and
I
'm
not
certain
whether
he
'd
try
and
get
me
moved
as
a
danger
to
junior
staff
,
or
you
moved
as
a
wicked
woman
.
But
he
'd
shift
one
of
us
.
His
staff
do
not
have
private
lives
and
certainly
not
with
each
other
.
"
She
looked
at
him
carefully
;
wrapped
in
a
sheet
,
with
her
blond
curly
hair
ruffled
,
she
looked
like
an
advertisement
for
almost
anything
.
"
Sorry
,
you
're
right
,
"
she
said
.
"
It
would
be
me
he
'd
try
and
shift
,
too
.
He
's
not
got
much
of
a
reputation
as
a
feminist
.
"
"
The
Met
's
a
bit
short
of
those
,
"
McLeish
agreed
.
"
Look
,
you
get
some
sleep
.
I
'll
go
and
see
the
car
and
get
back
to
my
flat
,
and
I
'll
pick
you
up
at
seven-thirty
tomorrow
.
All
right
?
"
"
You
'd
like
to
get
home
?
"
She
was
perfectly
secure
in
her
own
attractions
and
amused
,
and
McLeish
was
disconcerted
.
"
No
,
I
mean
-
no
.
I
just
thought
you
would
n't
want
to
be
woken
up
again
.
"

I
do
n't

"
He
found
himself
avoiding
the
street
in
which
Francesca
lived
as
he
drove
for
North
Kensington
,
calling
ahead
on
his
car
phone
to
make
sure
that
the
forensic
team
was
still
there
.
He
arrived
to
find
them
just
finishing
and
asked
hopefully
if
any
prints
had
been
found
.
"
No
prints
on
the
steering-wheel
or
any
of
the
doors
.
Somebody
's
been
over
it
with
a
duster
.
They
probably
wore
gloves
,
too
.
We
've
got
some
smudges
but
that
's
not
a
lot
of
use
.
"
McLeish
left
them
to
it
and
walked
away
to
consider
exactly
where
he
was
.
It
was
a
cul-de-sac
off
Ladbroke
Grove
,
with
two
restaurants
and
two
large
pubs
at
the
top
of
it
.
The
pub
was
orthodoxly
darkened
and
shuttered
,
but
a
few
diners
were
still
left
in
the
restaurants
.
It
was
a
road
on
the
way
up
,
this
Malplaquet
Terrace
,
as
McLeish
,
a
Londoner
by
adoption
,
observed
.
The
two
large
pubs
,
the
little
Indian
grocer
,
and
the
shabby
peeling
premises
which
offered
dry-cleaning
were
relics
of
an
earlier
era
,
but
both
restaurants
,
on
the
other
hand
,
were
new
and
forbiddingly
smart
.
One
was
Italian
,
one
French
;
both
were
separated
from
the
street
by
extensive
terraces
and
were
distinctly
expensive
.
He
peered
at
the
menu
displayed
with
accompanying
admiring
press
comment
outside
the
Trattoria
San
Giorgio
,
and
decided
you
'd
be
lucky
to
get
out
of
there
under
£20
a
head
.
La
Bretagne
looked
even
pricier
.
Next
to
these
was
a
small
antique
shop
,
window
lights
on
even
at
this
hour
,
displaying
elegant
white
china
dogs
and
small
pieces
of
Victorian
furniture
,
and
next
to
that
an
estate
agent
.
It
would
only
be
a
matter
of
ti
me
before
the
pubs
,
the
little
grocer
and
the
dry-cleaner
's
were
replaced
by
some
establishment
selling
something
on
which
an
enormous
mark-up
could
be
obtained
.
As
he
walked
back
down
the
cul-de-sac
McLeish
found
a
demarcation
line
,
so
precise
it
might
have
been
achieved
by
running
a
tape
across
the
road
,
where
the
commercial
element
stopped
and
flat-fronted
,
early
Victorian
terraced
houses
,
took
over
.
Further
down
yet
,
the
terracing
ceased
and
became
pairs
of
large
semi-detached
houses
set
well
back
from
the
road
with
the
front
gardens
mostly
paved
and
dedicated
to
parking
space
.
It
was
possible
to
see
the
same
sort
of
divide
as
at
the
commercial
end
:
every
second
house
had
been
restored
and
repainted
,
with
extensions
sprouting
in
the
gaps
between
them
.
Most
of
the
others
seemed
to
be
in
the
process
of
renovation
.
McLeish
counted
,
out
of
interest
,
ten
separate
sets
of
scaffolding
.
People
would
still
be
living
here
who
had
been
in
residence
since
before
the
war
and
were
holding
on
to
controlled
tenancies
until
dislodged
by
offers
of
cash
or
other
accommodation
,
but
they
would
not
be
there
much
longer
.
He
had
arrived
back
beside
Angela
Morgan
's
car
,
and
stopped
to
contemplate
it
.
A
blue
BMW
,
neat
but
not
gaudy
,
not
souped-up
,
but
a
fast
,
useful
car
.
On
her
money
she
could
well
have
afforded
something
grander
,
like
a
Porsche
,
but
evidently
she
had
decided
against
ostentation
.
It
was
the
sort
of
car
that
a
successful
young
man
bought
for
himself
,
not
a
woman
's
car
in
the
generally
used
sense
of
the
phrase
,
nor
a
car
that
a
man
would
choose
for
a
woman
.
It
was
neither
the
sensible
shopping-basket
that
men
bought
for
their
wives
,
nor
the
flashy
jobs
rich
men
bought
for
their
mistresses
.
He
looked
at
the
number
plate
and
realized
that
he
had
found
the
sole
piece
of
ostentation
Miss
Morgan
had
allowed
herself
;
she
had
been
Angela
Jane
Morgan
and
the
car
was
AJM
563
.
She
must
have
had
to
pay
a
bit
for
that
.
The
car
was
parked
neatly
between
two
patches
of
off-street
parking
,
in
one
of
the
very
few
parts
of
the
street
that
was
neither
metered
nor
dedicated
to
residents
'
parking
.
Not
put
here
by
chance
then
;
someone
had
known
this
street
.
Assuming
the
car
had
gone
missing
at
the
same
ti
me
as
Angela
Morgan
,
it
might
have
been
there
for
over
a
week
;
it
had
only
been
found
that
evening
by
a
uniformed
constable
who
was
keeping
his
eyes
open
.
Evidently
,
people
in
this
street
were
used
to
strange
cars
being
parked
and
nobody
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
ring
the
police
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
doors
bristled
with
Neighbourhood
Watch
signs
.
Perhaps
the
car
had
not
actually
been
there
since
Angela
Morgan
disappeared
,
but
that
seemed
unlikely
.
He
asked
the
forensic
team
leader
for
his
views
and
the
man
shook
his
head
.
"
I
would
think
it
's
been
here
for
several
days
,
sir
.
It
's
covered
with
dust
and
the
road
's
dry
underneath
,
although
we
've
had
a
lot
of
rain
.
"
"
Anything
useful
?

"
We
've
got
some
tiny
samples

the
tyres

's
been

the
mud
somewhere
.
We
'll

it
with
what
we
took
up
at
the
site

"

car

"
He
cleaned
it
first
,
then
,
before
dumping
it
,
sir
.
Nothing
on
it
,
just
a
few
smudges
.
Probably
put
it
through
a
car-wash

inside
has
been
vacuumed
recently

not
getting
much
here

'll
take
it
apart

get
it
away

here

course

"
Both
men
stood
aside
to
let
a
big
dark-green
Jaguar
edge
carefully
round
them
on
to
the
forecourt
of
the
house
immediately
to
the
left
of
where
the
BMW
was
parked
.
A
small
bouncy
couple
in
their
fifties
got
out
,
staring
at
the
lights
and
the
screens
round
Angela
Morgan
's
car
,
and
came
over
to
them
with
all
the
confidence
of
the
middle-class
member
of
a
Neighbourhood
Watch
scheme
.
"
Can
I
help
?
That
car
's
been
parked
there
over
a
week
,
and
I
was
just
beginning
to
wonder
about
ringing
the
police
.
Lots
of
people
from
the
restaurants
park
down
here
in
the
evening
,
but
I
only
just
realized
,
talking
to
my
wife
,
that
it
had

"
McLeish
,
tired
as
he
was
,
fell
promptly
on
this
witness
and
accepted
an
invitation
to
coffee
.
The
Masters
had
been
out
to
dinner
and
were
well
mellowed
,
wide
awake
and
disposed
to
chat
,
but
sitting
in
their
quarry-tiled
kitchen-diner
,
with
thousands
of
pounds
'
worth
of
elegant
cabinet
work
and
expensive
machinery
around
him
,
McLeish
managed
to
extract
a
coherent
story
.
Mr
Masters
was
quite
clear
that
he
had
first
seen
the
blue
BMW
late
on
the
Saturday
evening
,
ten
days
before
,
pointing
out
that
,
while
you
could
n't
exactly
complain
,
it
had
made
access
to
his
own
forecourt
space
a
little
difficult
,
or
at
least
when
there
was
already
another
car
on
the
forecourt
,
which
there
mostly
was
,
that
being
Mrs
Masters
's
runabout
.
He
was
sure
it
had
been
there
every
night
since
,
and
Mrs
Masters
turned
out
to
be
equally
confident
that
it
had
also
been
there
during
the
day
.
They
had
looked
at
each
other
,
disconcerted
at
this
apparent
lack
of
liaison
,
but
McLeish
had
been
reassuring
:
very
natural
that
they
had
n't
compared
notes
,
extremely
useful
that
he
now
knew
how
long
the
car
had
been
there
.
"
Was
it
stolen
,
Chief
Inspector
?
I
mean
,
do
chief
inspectors
look
at
stolen
cars
?
We
've
never
seen
much
above
a
detective
sergeant
in
the
road
before
?
"
Mr
Masters
,
mellow
or
not
,
had
gathered
his
wits
.
He
was
a
small
bright-eyed
,
balding
,
active
man
,
interested
in
everything
around
him
.
"
Not
necessarily
.
We
've
been
looking
for
this
car
as
part
of
a
murder
investigation
.
It
belonged
to
a
Miss
Angela
Morgan
,
and
you
may
have
seen
the
death
reported
.
"
"
What
's
the
matter
with
me
?
"
Mr
Masters
enquired
,
smiting
himself
on
the
forehead
.
"
I
saw
it
in
the
papers
,
I
even
noticed
that
the
car
was
missing
,
and
it
was
a
BMW
.
I
just
did
n't
put
it
together
.
"
"
You
would
have

later

McLeish
said
,
liking
the
man
.
"
That
's
what
happens
,
something
ticks
away
in
your
mind
and
you
suddenly
realize
there
's
a
connection
.
We
'll
have
to
send
people
round
all
the
houses
in
the
street
,
see
if
anyone
saw
the
person
who
left
the
car
here
.
"
"
Could
have
been
the
girl
herself
?
"
"
Yes
,
possibly
.
"
McLeish
decided
not
to
expand
,
and
rose
to
go
,
conscious
that
it
was
one-thirty
a.m
.
And
that
he
had
an
interview
at
eight
in
the
morning
.
He
found
at
the
edge
of
his
consciousness
the
wish
that
he
was
just
going
to
his
own
flat
to
crash
out
rather
than
back
to
share
Catherine
's
warm
bed
.
At
eight
a.m.
it
was
pouring
with
rain
,
and
very
cold
,
as
the
partners
of
Yeo
Davis
straggled
in
through
the
neat
entrance
,
their
footsteps
echoing
on
the
tiles
.
It
was
far
too
early
for
the
immaculate
and
highly
paid
receptionist
to
be
in
;
in
fact
,
no
one
below
the
level
of
partner
was
present
.
Peter
Yeo
,
accustomed
to
leading
from
the
front
,
had
arrived
at
seven-thirty
and
personally
made
the
coffee
and
brought
in
croissants
,
so
that
the
reassuring
presence
of
food
greeted
the
other
three
partners
.
"
Sorry
to
get
you
here

early

he
said
,

Angela

have
to

a

today

Tim
Reagan
,
a
gaunt
forty-year-old
,
who
was
a
genius
with
trade
unions
as
well
as
being
an
accountant
and
Peter
Yeo
's
right
hand
,
moved
swiftly
through
the
secretarial
problem
,
which
was
one
of
shortage
of
same
,
and
seemed
,
as
Peter
Yeo
observed
pleasantly
,
to
have
been
exactly
the
same
difficulty
any
time
in
the
last
two
years
,
to
a
discussion
of
building
security
,
in
which
no
one
was
much
interested
either
.
"
The
next
problem

"
Tim
said
,
noticing
sardonically
that
his
partners
'
level
of
attention
rose
sharply
.
"
As
you
all

eleven
months
ago

they
were
one
of
Richard

"
He
paused
and
the
meeting
observed
a
thirty-second
silence
in
honour
of
Richard
Fairley
who
had
left
the
partnership
a
year
previously
for
considerably
more
than
a
handful
of
silver
,
taking
with
him

reason
for
being
interested
in
paying
Yeo
Davis
's
bills

've

"

the
next
most
senior
partner
enquired
hopefully
,
invoking
what
all
felt
to
be
the
partnership
's
most
powerful
weapon
.

Peter
Yeo
roused
himself
.
"
Brady
and
I
lunched
,
and
we
've
talked
several
times
.

's
been

sweetness

light
,
promised
nothing

done
ditto
.
"
"
Do
we
have
to
sue

"
the
questioner
pressed
,
unhappily
,
and
Tim
Reagan
considered
him
wearily
.
"
Mike
,
that
£400,000
sits
in
our
last
year
's
accounts
as
an
asset
-
a
debt
someone
owes
us
.
It
's
in
this
year
's
draft
accounts
too
,
but
we
have
people
called
auditors
who
are
going
to
recognize
this
bill
,
and
ask
all
sorts
of
boring
questions
like
why
it
has
not
been
paid
,
whether
it
is
likely
to
be
paid
,
and
if
so
when
.
And
if
we
ca
n't
produce
some
pretty
credible
answers
then
they
wo
n't
allow
that
£400,000
to
sit
in
the
accounts
at
the
full
value
.
Either
we
'll
have
to
take
a
very
heavy
discount
on
it
,
or
we
'll
get
our
accounts
qualified
.
The
other
even
more
pressing
reason
is
that
we
need
the
cash
;
we
're
running
an
overdraft
and
that
's
not
funny
with
these

rates

Peter
Yeo
,
who
had
been
watching
his
partners
,
realized
that
he
and
Tim
were
not
carrying
the
other
two
and
decided
to
make
another
effort
.
"
The
reason
the
auditors
will
give
us
trouble
,
Mike
,
is
that
they
have
to
certify
that
our
accounts
give
a
true
and
fair
account
of
the
financial
state
of
the
business
.
And
if
we
have
£400,000
in
there
which
is
n't
really
£400,000
,
then
the
accounts
do
n't
tell
you
what
's
going
on

He
watched
grimly
as
Mike
Laister
,
easily
the
best
man
with
any
drinks
company
,
grasped
the
point
.

is
n't
worth

Tim

brought
to
the
sticking
point

somewhat
reproachfully
,

passed
on
firmly

was
going

over

him
out
of
the
door

In
the
hall
sat
Claudia
Yeo
herself
,
evidently
waiting
for
her
husband
,
and
Tim
stopped
to
say
hello
to
her
.
She
looked
as
if
she
needed
that
weekend
away
.
She
was
overweight
,
overtired
,
distinctly
anxious
,
her
hair
was
untidy
,
and
both
her
suit
and
her
shoes
were
in
need
of
a
clean
.
Not
what
one
expected
of
the
wife
of
the
senior
partner
,
Tim
observed
,
thinking
smugly
of
his
own
immaculately
turned-out
Patrice
,
who
would
refuse
to
eat
if
she
put
on
even
an
extra
pound
and
who
would
as
soon
leave
the
house
naked
as
without
make-up
.

Oh

Peter

His
senior
partner

not
at
all
ravished
by
this
incursion
into
his
working
day

observed
maliciously
,

faded
tactfully
away

his

They
glared
at
each
other
across
the
table

two
people
in
early
middle

had
had
the

quarrel
in
the

desisted

a

house-to-house
interviews
in
Malplaquet
Terrace
,
to
see
if
anyone
could
be
found
who
had
seen
the
blue
BMW
arrive
or
caught
sight
of
its
driver
.
McLeish
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
interview
room
and
looked
in
through
the
spy-hole
,
wanting
to
get
some
feel
for
the
evidently
hostile
and
,
by
all
accounts
,
neurotic
Penelope
Huntley
.
His
first
sight
of
her
was
reassuringly
normal
:
a
tall
,
dark
girl
dressed
in
a
good
grey
suit
of
the
type
favoured
by
Francesca
,
which
acted
effectively
as
a
uniform
without
doing
much
for
her
.
An
expensive
handbag
lay
on
the
table
,
and
she
was
reading
the
morning
paper
in
a
perfectly
ordinary
way
.
But
as
she
lifted
her
head
to
greet
them
,
McLeish
decided
the
first
impression
had
been
false
.
Her
hair
was
lank
,
her
skin
blotchy
and
spotty
.
She
was
evidently
a
heavy
smoker
for
the
first
two
fingers
of
her
right
hand
were
stained
with
nicotine
,
and
,
now
that
he
looked
,
the
nails
were
bitten
and
the
cuticles
chewed
raw
.
She
looked
as
if
she
had
just
got
out
of
bed
,
and
McLeish
had
a
sudden
vision
of
a
dark
basement
flat
with
greasy
mugs
on
every
surface
.
She
looked
both
wary
and
defiant
;
well
,
people
often
did
,
faced
with
the
police
,
but
it
was
an
unusual
combination
to
find
in
a
girl
from
the
confident
middle
class
.
"
Is
it
not
warm
enough
in
here
?
"
he
enquired
by
way
of
greeting
,
seeing
her
clasping
her
jacket
round
her
.
Penelope
Huntley
let
go
of
it
anxiously
and
said
no
,
that
it
was
perfectly
fine
,
she
'd
just
been
cold
outside
.
McLeish
took
her
briskly
through
the
course
,
making
the
now
familiar
speech
about
Angela
Morgan
's
death
being
treated
as
a
case
of
murder
,
which
meant
taking
statements
from
everyone
who
had
been
associated
with
her
and
might
be
helpful
.
Penelope
Huntley
sat
silent
through
this
speech
,
chain-smoking
,
her
eyes
downcast
.
In
the
end
he
stopped
talking
and
watched
her
till
she
looked
at
him
,
sideways
and
warily
.
"
In
the
course
of
this
process
we
have
talked
to
Miss
Morgan
's
solicitor
,
who
told
us
that
she
was
the
life
tenant
of
a
substantial
estate
,
and
that
you
are
what
they
call
the
remainder-man
.
"
"
That
is
the
correct
term
,
yes
.
It
was
my
Uncle
Bill
's
money
.
"
Well
,
that
woke
her
up
,
McLeish
thought
,
watching
the
-
restless
fingers
.
The
sight
of
a
young
woman
alternately
smoking
her
head
off
and
chewing
her
cuticles
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
.
"
I
understand
that
a
substantial
part
of
his
estate
was
left
to
Miss
Morgan
?
"
he
enquired
,
with
a
strong
feeling
of
throwing
petrol
on
to
a
fire
.
"
Yes
,
it
was
.
We
both
got
legacies
,
and
she
got
the
bulk
of
the
estate
for
her
lifetime
.
She
was
his
mistress
,
of
course
,
although
she
was
over
thirty
years
younger
than
him
.
"
She
ground
a
half-smoked
cigarette
into
the
ashtray
,
and
McLeish
was
left
with
the
feeling
that
she
would
willingly
have
done
the
same
to
the
live
flesh
of
Angela
Morgan
,
if
available
.
"
How
do
you
feel
about
that
?
"
Her
head
came
up
and
she
looked
him
in
the
eye
.
"
Well
,
it
was
his
money
,
was
n't
it
,
and
I
was
only
his
niece
.
I
was
disappointed
of
course
,
but
I
got
over
it
.
"
A
good
prepared
speech
,
McLeish
thought
,
with
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
.
In
fact
,
he
realized
,
she
had
simply
adopted
the
words
other
people
must
have
said
to
her
over
and
over
again
.
He
wondered
whether
she
had
always
been
quite
so
uncaring
of
her
appearance
or
whether
it
had
been
grief
and
rage
at
Uncle
Bill
's
defection
that
had
started
this
off
.
Not
a
very
easy
question
to
ask
.
"
Were
you
close
to
your
uncle
?
"
"
Till
she
came
along
,
"
The
answer
was
like
a
rifle
shot
,
full
of
pent-up
rage
,
and
McLeish
sat
back
.
"
You
felt
she
displaced
you
-
with
him
,
I
mean
?
"
"
Well
,
she
had
all
the
advantages
,
did
n't
she
?
"
Penelope
Huntley
was
destroying
the
remaining
cuticles
on
her
left
hand
,
a
finger
pushed
savagely
against
her
teeth
.
"
I
mean
,
she
could
go
to
bed
with
him
.
He
wanted
her
,
and
he
was
getting
old
and
silly
.
"
"
I
understand
that
he
was
sixty-two
when
he
died
,
"
McLeish
said
,
drily
.
"
It
's
not
all
that
old
.
"
"
He
was
idiotic
about
her
.
Completely
OTT
.
She
did
n't
really
care
about
him
at
all
,
she
just
wanted
his
money
.
"
McLeish
decided
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
suggest
that
it
would
have
hardly
been
reasonable
for
Angela
Morgan
to
expect
to
inherit
a
quick
fortune
from
a
man
of
sixty-two
.
"
They
had
no
plans
to
marry
,
then
?
"
"
Of
course
not
.
Or
she
did
n't
.
She
was
just
stringing
him
along
.
"
"
Even
though
she
would
have
been
a
rich
woman
had
she
married
him
?
"
Penelope
Huntley
looked
momentarily
disoriented
,
but
any
recognition
that
a
valid
point
had
been
made
disappeared
and
she
went
back
to
chewing
her
cuticles
.
"
You
now
,
of
course
,
come
into
possession
of
a
substantial
sum
,
following
Miss
Morgan
's
death
,
"
McLeish
observed
,
sounding
as
accusing
as
he
could
,
and
she
stopped
chewing
and
gave
him
her
full
attention
.
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
Not
anything
like
it
would
have
been
if
Uncle
Bill
had
left
it
to
me
in
the
first
place
,
because
it
will
pay
duty
twice
.
"
"
But
more
than
you
would
have
got
if
Miss
Morgan
had
agreed
to
your
suggestion
of
splitting
the
fund
up
between
you
.
"
How
did
you
know
about
that
?
Solicitors
,
I
suppose
-
if
it
was
mine
I
'll
find
new
ones
.
"
She
glared
at
McLeish
,
who
looked
deadpan
.
"
Yes
,
I
would
n't
have
got
all
that
much
,
but
she
would
n't
even
agree
to
that
,
greedy
cow
.
"
The
sudden
descent
into
abuse
took
McLeish
by
surprise
and
he
realized
he
must
have
shown
it
,
because
the
girl
literally
got
a
grip
on
herself
,
folding
her
arms
and
hunching
over
the
table
.
"
Well
,
you
've
got
it
now
,
"
he
said
crudely
,
and
watched
with
fascination
as
the
corners
of
her
mouth
tucked
in
smugly
.
"
I
'd
like
to
go
over
your
movements
with
you
for
last
Saturday
,
Sunday
and
Monday
week
,
please
,
"
he
went
on
crisply
.
Penelope
Huntley
looked
at
him
in
amazement
,
with
dawning
understanding
.
More
human
than
she
'd
looked
all
morning
,
he
thought
,
realizing
he
had
taken
against
his
witness
at
least
partly
because
she
was
alive
and
the
amusing
,
lively
,
feminine
creature
that
had
been
Angela
Morgan
was
not
.
Uncle
Bill
had
been
a
wise
man
to
leave
the
money
to
Angela
,
who
had
enjoyed
it
,
rather
than
to
this
grudging
,
bitter
,
scruffy
young
woman
.
"
I
did
n't
kill
her
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
I
thought
of
it
at
one
ti
me
,
but
I
knew
I
'd
make
a
mess
of
it
.
"
She
bit
-
savagely
at
her
cuticles
again
,
and
McLeish
had
to
fight
back
the
urge
to
yell
at
her
to
stop
,
for
God
's
sake
.
"
Could
you
tell
us
where
you
were
and
what
you
were
doing
on
those
three
days
,
please
?
"
he
said
,
instead
,
levelly
and
she
gave
him
another
sideways
,
calculating
look
.
"
Including
,
please
,
names
and
addresses
of
anyone
you
spent
time
with
,
"
he
added
pleasantly
and
saw
her
understand
that
he
was
serious
and
she
had
better
get
her
act
together
.
It
seemed
to
take
an
unreasonably
long
time
and
much
bad
temper
,
evasion
and
deliberate
obfuscation
,
together
with
consultation
of
a
diary
that
appeared
to
be
alternately
blank
and
covered
with
scribbled
hieroglyphics
.
And
the
narrative
extracted
with
such
difficulty
was
not
helpful
.
Miss
Huntley
claimed
to
have
spent
the
Saturday
by
herself
in
and
around
her
flat
,
doing
a
bit
of
shopping
and
cleaning
before
meeting
a
few
friends
-
only
one
of
whom
appeared
to
have
an
address
-
and
going
on
to
a
party
around
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
A
large
party
,
in
and
out
of
which
people
had
evidently
flowed
like
water
circulating
in
a
swimming
pool
.
Sunday
was
not
much
better
;
Miss
Huntley
had
not
risen
from
her
bed
until
one
p.m.
and
had
not
left
the
flat
until
five
,
then
only
to
go
to
the
cinema
.
On
Monday
she
had
gone
to
her
job
-
improbably
she
appeared
to
be
a
supervisor
for
a
market
research
firm
-
as
usual
,
and
could
be
vouched
for
by
colleagues
there
.
Well
,
two
colleagues
anyway
.
No
,
she
did
not
own
a
car
-
could
not
afford
to
-
but
she
did
have
a
driving
licence
.
Uncle
Bill
had
run
a
car
for
her
on
his
company
while
he
was
alive
but
of
course
that
had
all
stopped
when
he
died
.
McLeish
,
who
remembered
that
she
had
been
left
£200,000
outright
,
received
this
as
further
evidence
that
the
young
woman
had
gone
into
a
massive
sulk
after
her
uncle
's
unexpected
death
.
It
was
difficult
to
tell
,
of
course
,
whether
she
had
always
possessed
an
unattractive
,
aggressive
,
sullen
personality
,
or
whether
rejection
by
her
uncle
in
favour
of
Angela
Morgan
had
tipped
her
over
into
this
behaviour
.
Perhaps
she
would
brighten
up
now
that
she
had
another
substantial
amount
of
cash
to
spend
.
He
asked
her
to
come
back
as
suited
her
to
sign
her
statement
,
and
she
made
all
kinds
of
difficulties
about
when
this
would
be
possible
.
He
finally
dealt
with
that
by
saying
briskly
that
one
of
his
staff
would
come
to
her
place
of
business
.
She
opened
her
mouth
to
argue
further
,
being
plainly
in
the
mood
to
announce
she
was
leaving
her
job
rather
than
allow
any
arrangement
to
succeed
,
but
something
about
McLeish
's
expression
checked
her
and
she
agreed
meekly
.
McLeish
saw
her
off
and
returned
to
confer
with
Catherine
.
"
You
get
all
that
?
It
'll
all
have
to
be
checked
-
you
've
got
Donalds
and
Ridley
to
do
that
.
"
He
gazed
at
her
bent
head
as
she
read
through
her
notes
,
and
she
looked
up
and
smiled
faintly
at
him
.
"
Shall
I
do
it
now
?
"
"
Not
yet
.
What
did
you
think
of
Miss
Huntley
?
What
a
bitch
,
eh
?
"
Catherine
considered
him
thoughtfully
.
"
I
was
sorry
for
her
.
Her
dad
died
,
then
her
uncle
went
off
with
someone
else
.
And
left
his
money
away
from
her
.
"
"
I
had
n't
quite
seen
it
like
that
,
"
McLeish
acknowledged
humbly
,
remembering
that
the
beautiful
woman
in
front
of
him
,
whom
you
could
not
suppose
ever
to
have
encountered
rejection
in
any
form
,
had
lost
a
father
when
young
,
and
had
been
so
little
attached
to
her
stepfather
that
she
had
left
home
at
the
earliest
opportunity
.
"
She
is
in
the
frame
,
though
?
"
he
suggested

Oh
yes
.
What
was
it
she
would
get
on
Angela
Morgan
's
death
-
about
£120,000
after
taxes
?
And
I
suppose
she
feels
she
's
won
.
I
mean
she
's
alive
,
is
n't
she
?
"
McLeish
observed
soberly
that
£120,000
and
the
death
of
a
hated
rival
seemed
a
prize
well
worth
playing
for
.
"
She
's
got
a
nasty
enough
temper
-
I
just
do
n't
myself
see
her
as
clever
or
organized
enough
to
cover
her
tracks
.
Well
,
perhaps
you
'll
find
she
has
n't
-
it
's
not
much
of
an
alibi
,
is
it
?
"
"
No
.
Gaps
all
over
Saturday
and
Sunday
-
you
reckon
Angela
was
killed
then
,
rather
than
Monday
?
"
"
I
reckon
Saturday
.
We
've
got
no
sighting
of
her
after
first
thing
Saturday
morning
.
"
Catherine
Crane
looked
at
-
him
carefully
,
and
he
grinned
at
her
.
"
Come
on
,
I
know
that
look
now
.
What
am
I
missing
?
"
She
blushed
.
"
It
's
just
that
the
only
person
who
saw
her
on
Saturday
was
the
Minister
-
Mr
Hawick
.
"
"
Why
would
he
be
lying
?
"
"
Only
if
he
was
the
murderer
and
had
actually
killed
her
earlier
.
"
McLeish
sighed
.
"
I
'd
not
forgotten
him
,
but
I
just
could
n't
see
why
he
'd
want
to
kill
her
.
He
did
n't
get
any
of
her
money
if
she
died
before
they
were
married
.
"
"
It
could
have
been
jealousy
.
Mrs
Morgan
did
think
there
was
,
or
had
been
,
something
with
her
boss
.
And
Mr
Hawick
did
n't
seem
to
me
the
kind
of
chap
who
'd
put
up
with
that
.
"
McLeish
nodded
,
not
entirely
convinced
,
but
unwilling
for
a
variety
of
reasons
to
discourage
Catherine
.
"
We
need
to
check
what
he
was
doing
those
days
,
anyway
-
I
did
n't
try
too
hard
when
we
were
last
there
,
because
I
hoped
the
autopsy
might
give
us
something
.
As
it
did
.
I
'll
get
Jenny
to
fix
it
.
"
She
nodded
,
and
he
sat
looking
at
her
until
she
looked
back
at
him
.
He
glanced
up
at
the
spy-hole
and
grinned
.
"
Let's
get
some
lunch
.
I
ca
n't
face
the
canteen
but
there
's
a
trattoria
round
the
corner
.
I
never
see
anyone
from
this
place
there
.
"
They
ate
in
the
small
crowded
Italian
restaurant
which
was
,
as
he
had
promised
,
free
of
their
New
Scotland
Yard
colleagues
.
It
was
also
free
of
DTI
civil
servants
as
he
had
quietly
ascertained
while
they
waited
for
their
lunch
to
arrive
.
They
walked
out
into
a
cold
,
bright
day
,
into
one
of
the
labyrinthine
streets
by
the
side
of
Westminster
Abbey
,
straight
into
a
column
of
knickerbockered
children
chattering
hard
and
sweeping
all
before
them
.
As
they
stood
patiently
in
a
doorway
waiting
for
the
column
to
pass
,
Catherine
turned
to
say
something
to
McLeish
and
he
looked
down
at
her
for
a
long
moment
.
"
Better
get
back
.
"
Smiling
to
himself
,
he
looked
idly
across
the
road
and
saw
Francesca
,
who
should
not
have
been
back
till
Thursday
.
She
was
not
looking
in
their
direction
,
her
head
was
turned
to
say
something
to
whomever
she
was
with
,
her
short
hair
blown
straight
up
by
the
wind
as
they
went
into
the
little
newsagent
's
,
leaving
McLeish
a
clear
run
to
get
Catherine
back
to
the
Yard
.
He
walked
heavily
beside
her
,
trying
to
convince
himself
that
Francesca
had
not
seen
them
.
But
she
had
,
of
course
she
had
;
that
was
why
she
had
fled
.
He
got
back
to
his
own
desk
and
sat
,
looking
at
his
hands
,
unable
to
decide
whether
to
ring
her
up
,
or
what
to
say
.
