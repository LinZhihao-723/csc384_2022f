The
restaurant
was
packed
,
Saturday
evenings
always
fully
booked
at
The
Magpie
,
the
best
eating
house
in
the
small
commuter
town
twenty-one
miles
north
of
London
.
The
six
people
at
a
corner
table
were
well
known
to
the
proprietor
,
who
saw
them
regularly
in
the
winter
months
.
Two
of
the
couples
were
obviously
married
,
and
in
their
early
fifties
,
but
sitting
at
opposite
ends
of
the
length
of
the
table
were
a
silver-haired
woman
still
showing
some
of
the
beauty
that
had
helped
make
her
a
famous
actress
in
the
forties
;
and
a
broad-shouldered
young
man
.
From
the
facial
resemblance
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
her
son
.
But
his
features
were
carved
from
stronger
stuff
,
the
mouth
wider
beneath
a
nose
that
was
broken
though
still
straight
.
His
jaw
was
thrusting
enough
if
not
thick
set
,
with
dark
hair
that
was
short
and
wavy
,
with
a
touch
of
premature
grey
at
the
temples
.
The
only
thing
entirely
common
to
both
was
the
good-natured
warmth
of
their
brown
eyes
and
the
crinkles
in
the
skin
at
the
corners
,
especially
when
they
laughed
.
The
candlelight
reflected
on
his
gold
wristwatch
as
he
held
a
lighter
to
the
cigarette
of
one
of
the
women
.
His
Chester
Barrie
suit
was
cut
in
grey
flannel
,
the
blue
silk
handkerchief
flowing
from
his
breast
pocket
matching
his
shirt
and
tie
.
The
people
were
all
obviously
successful
,
a
scene
duplicated
at
all
the
tables
of
The
Magpie
:
success
in
the
City
,
in
Whitehall
,
in
the
Ivory
Towers
of
the
great
teaching
hospitals
,
and
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
But
whereas
the
faces
all
around
were
pale
,
or
a
smooth
golden
bronze
from
holidays
chasing
the
winter
sun
,
his
was
ruddy
,
weathered
,
the
creases
radiating
from
the
eyes
suggesting
a
life
soaking
up
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
wind
.
It
was
a
face
out
of
place
in
the
room
of
suburban
dwellers
.
The
woman
pulled
on
her
cigarette
,
then
blew
the
smoke
away
straight
up
into
the
air
with
an
exaggerated
abandonment
.
The
man
said
something
and
they
all
laughed
,
the
woman
giving
him
a
mock
slap
on
the
arm
.
It
was
a
relaxed
,
happy
birthday
party
with
his
mother
and
family
friends
,
for
John
Delaney
was
now
thirty-three
years
of
age
.
The
were
about
to
select
from
the
sweet
trolley
when
,
at
a
nod
from
his
mother
,
the
proprietor
dimmed
the
houselights
and
a
young
waitress
brought
in
a
surprise
birthday
cake
,
the
reflection
from
the
candles
throwing
her
face
into
warm
relief
.
They
all
sang
Happy
Birthday
.
John
Delaney
pretended
to
back
away
.
"
My
God
!
"
he
quipped
,
"
it
's
a
blazing
inferno
.
"
"
Do
n't
forget
to
make
a
wish
,
John
,
"
his
mother
called
out
.
With
lots
of
good-natured
bantering
,
Delaney
blew
them
out
.
The
proprietor
took
over
,
and
was
still
serving
the
portions
when
one
of
the
waitresses
came
in
and
whispered
something
to
Delaney
.
He
frowned
,
pulled
the
napkin
from
his
lap
and
laid
it
on
the
table
as
he
stood
up
,
shrugging
apologetically
to
his
mother
,
seeming
to
indicate
that
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
had
happened
before
,
from
time
to
time
.
Was
he
a
doctor
or
a
QC
used
to
sudden
,
unsocial
calls
?
But
the
look
on
Vanessa
Delaney
's
face
as
she
watched
her
son
edge
his
way
through
the
tables
was
tinged
with
something
that
had
no
place
in
such
a
mundane
event
.
Something
she
could
not
disguise
.
Fear
.
He
had
been
called
like
this
only
three
times
before
-
to
her
knowledge
.
That
was
when
he
had
been
in
the
SAS
.
Once
,
for
something
in
Ulster
.
Once
for
something
she
had
never
found
out
about
.
And
then
the
last
time
;
that
had
turned
out
to
be
a
walk
on
the
wild
side
.
In
Argentina
.
Eugene
Forster
was
in
his
bath
,
drawing
contentedly
on
a
cigar
,
tumbler
of
whisky
and
water
held
in
his
hand
,
arm
laid
languidly
along
the
tiled
border
.
His
eyes
were
closed
as
he
perceived
pleasure
from
all
of
his
senses
,
except
that
of
sight
.
The
whisky
.
The
richness
of
the
Havana
leaf
.
And
the
sound
of
Beethoven
's
Second
Romance
for
violin
and
orchestra
,
coming
from
the
stereo
speaker
in
his
bedroom
.
And
the
sense
of
t
ouch
.
Not
only
from
the
luxurious
,
all-enveloping
warmth
of
the
soapy
water
,
but
from
the
hands
lightly
moving
across
his
chest
,
the
fingers
caressing
the
dark
hair
.
The
hands
moved
away
,
downwards
,
across
the
hard
muscle
of
his
stomach
that
was
as
tough
and
flat
as
it
had
been
ten
years
ago
,
when
he
was
eighteen
.
Forster
's
eyes
opened
.
They
were
hard
pin-points
of
slate
blue
beneath
bushy
eyebrows
.
His
hair
was
long
and
thick
,
his
large
nose
aquiline
.
With
a
splash
his
hand
left
the
whisky
and
found
that
of
the
intruder
,
arresting
it
in
a
grip
that
made
the
girl
in
the
bath
beside
him
wince
.
"
Hey
,
Gene
,
"
she
cried
out
,
"
that
hurts
.
"
Forster
grinned
,
exposing
teeth
tipped
with
gold
.
Before
he
could
say
anything
,
the
telephone
on
the
Grecian
plinth
nearest
to
the
girl
gave
a
muted
double
purr
.
The
girl
picked
up
the
receiver
,
soap
suds
streaming
on
to
its
cover
.
"
Hello
,
"
she
said
,
and
listened
.
Bewildered
,
she
held
it
out
to
him
.
"
It
's
somebody
or
something
called
G9
.
"
Eugene
Forster
paused
,
raised
one
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
,
then
slowly
and
deliberately
,
with
the
wisdom
of
previous
experience
,
finished
the
whisky
,
drew
one
last
time
on
the
cigar
then
plunged
it
with
a
hiss
into
the
water
,
before
he
took
the
"
phone
.
Doctor
Anderson
was
busy
in
Casualty
,
just
completing
the
suturing
of
a
six-inch
gash
in
the
arm
of
a
policeman
,
when
the
bleeper
in
the
top
pocket
of
the
white
clinical
coat
emitted
a
plaintive
call
.
The
doctor
switched
it
off
and
carried
on
with
the
work
in
hand
.
It
was
some
eight
minutes
later
before
the
"
phone
in
Sister
's
office
was
used
.
Almost
immediately
the
discarded
white
coat
lay
beside
the
startled
Sister
,
who
was
left
to
call
the
Duty
Registrar
.
Shocked
,
she
stared
disbelievingly
at
the
receding
back
of
Doctor
Anderson
,
and
wondered
what
had
been
contained
in
the
message
that
had
made
a
member
of
the
staff
drop
everything
in
such
an
unprofessional
way
.
The
public
bar
of
The
East
Indiaman
was
full
,
the
atmosphere
thick
with
cigarette
smoke
,
the
noise
incredible
.
Over
in
the
corner
of
the
sizable
room
an
electronic
organ
was
giving
out
Moon
River
,
the
player
a
young
,
prematurely
bald
man
,
with
sweat
standing
out
on
the
smooth
,
polished
face
and
head
.
He
wore
an
open-necked
checked
shirt
,
and
jeans
,
and
occasionally
reached
for
the
pint
of
lager
at
his
side
.
The
crowd
of
cockneys
were
singing
along
,
rocking
from
side
to
side
,
men
with
arms
around
their
wives
and
girl
friends
,
tables
stacked
with
glasses
and
bottles
and
littered
with
ashtrays
and
empty
crisp
packets
.
When
the
dark
blue
uniforms
of
a
sergeant
and
constable
appeared
in
the
doorway
,
they
stood
out
like
sore
thumbs
,
causing
more
than
a
ripple
of
interest
from
the
somewhat
less
than
friendly
clientele
.
Edging
their
way
through
the
densely-packed
throng
they
finally
reached
the
organist
who
carried
on
playing
,
at
the
same
time
bending
down
an
ear
in
the
sergeant
's
direction
.
The
conversation
was
brief
.
In
mid-tune
,
the
organist
stopped
,
grabbed
his
jacket
,
and
surrounded
by
the
two
policemen
,
began
to
leave
.
"
Leave
him
alone
,
"
someone
yelled
,
"
and
go
and
arrest
one
of
those
geezers
who
live
up
in
Hampstead
.
"
Somebody
jostled
the
sergeant
's
arm
.
He
turned
,
and
pushed
the
man
away
.
And
then
it
exploded
into
a
riot
.
In
seconds
,
the
police
officers
'
hats
were
dislodged
from
their
owners
'
heads
,
and
they
disappeared
into
a
boiling
fighting
,
mass
of
humanity
.
Glasses
were
smashed
and
chairs
were
broken
.
A
wall
mirror
was
cracked
.
The
electronic
organ
was
over-turned
in
the
melee
.
And
women
screamed
.
The
young
man
,
Martin
Grant
,
struggling
through
the
throng
,
managed
to
get
to
the
door
when
the
sirens
and
the
flashing
blue
lights
outside
the
window
heralded
the
arrival
of
uniformed
reinforcements
.
As
he
made
to
leave
,
the
young
man
was
confronted
by
another
sergeant
,
with
a
night
stick
.
"
Oh
,
no
you
do
n't
,
sonny
.
Back
inside
.
"
Martin
Grant
started
to
say
something
but
received
a
jab
in
the
stomach
,
from
the
night
stick
.
The
sergeant
pushed
forward
,
then
remembered
nothing
more
until
he
regained
consciousness
in
an
ambulance
,
one
of
several
taking
a
selection
of
minor
injuries
to
hospital
.
But
the
prematurely
bald
young
man
was
not
among
them
.
Clint
Eastwood
struck
a
match
,
held
it
in
cupped
hands
,
and
bent
his
grizzled
and
unshaven
face
down
,
applying
the
cheroot
to
the
flame
.
But
his
eyes
never
left
the
four
men
before
him
.
A
shoot-out
was
inevitable
,
the
result
foregone
.
And
then
a
jumble
of
words
flashed
across
his
face
,
causing
cat-calls
and
boos
in
the
half-empty
cinema
.
URGENT
MESSAGE
FOR
MR
BARRY
SILK
AT
THE
MANAGER
'S
OFFICE
.
It
was
still
there
as
the
guns
blazed
.
Only
when
the
last
bullet
had
been
fired
and
when
Clint
Eastwood
had
matter-of-factly
and
deftly
dropped
the
six-shooter
back
into
its
holster
,
flicked
the
cheroot
away
and
walked
into
the
sunset
,
did
the
man
in
the
old
jacket
and
cords
,
legs
dangling
over
the
seat
in
front
,
get
up
and
shamble
slowly
up
the
darkened
aisle
.
In
the
bright
lights
of
the
foyer
his
face
was
clearly
illuminated
.
It
was
pock-marked
.
With
his
unkempt
ginger
hair
running
down
into
sideboards
it
made
his
hard
face
look
even
meaner
.
In
his
left
ear
he
wore
a
small
ring
.
In
a
Northern
Ireland
accent
he
asked
for
the
manager
's
office
.
Authoritatively
,
he
snapped
his
surname
into
the
"
phone
,
listened
for
a
second
or
two
,
then
replaced
the
receiver
on
to
its
cradle
.
Nodding
at
the
manager
he
left
the
office
without
a
further
word
.
Barry
Silk
had
killed
more
terrorists
and
a
few
other
criminals
in
his
old
hometown
of
Belfast
than
anybody
,
and
that
included
IRA
,
Loyalists
-
even
the
British
Army
-
would
ever
know
.
For
he
just
liked
to
kill
.
The
telephone
did
n't
ring
in
Theodore
Lawton
's
house
.
Despite
official
strictures
that
everybody
had
to
have
one
,
there
was
no
line
to
his
converted
nissen-hut
home
on
Dartmoor
.
If
contact
was
necessary
this
was
done
by
radio
.
He
was
a
tall
,
angular
man
in
his
early
forties
,
with
dark
receding
hair
brushed
straight
back
.
Lawton
removed
his
glasses
,
grabbed
his
jacket
,
and
followed
James
De
Vere
Green
,
the
friend
with
whom
he
shared
the
small-holding
together
with
an
assortment
of
dogs
,
four
horses
,
chickens
and
a
couple
of
pigs
,
out
of
the
door
.
He
made
his
way
to
the
old
barn
on
the
corner
of
their
three
acres
.
Together
they
pulled
back
the
high
door
,
which
despite
its
rustic
appearance
,
ran
smoothly
on
well-greased
and
balanced
rollers
.
The
heavy
duty
generators
,
ex-Army
mobile
field
units
,
roared
into
life
when
Lawton
cranked
the
handle
.
When
they
were
switched
on
the
lights
flooded
out
across
the
bare
,
flat
expanse
of
moorland
just
beyond
the
perimeter
of
their
property
.
De
Vere
Green
was
already
up
in
the
seat
of
the
converted
Sno-cat
that
they
used
as
a
tractor
,
its
caterpillar
track
ideal
for
use
in
the
harsh
Dartmoor
winters
.
But
now
he
was
using
it
to
draw
out
their
other
piece
of
essential
winter
equipment
.
It
,
too
,
had
been
bought
ex-Services
.
The
barn
served
as
a
hanger
for
their
Gazelle
helicopter
,
which
now
stood
illuminated
by
the
floodlights
on
the
roof
,
its
belly
reflecting
the
landing
lights
set
in
cement
housings
.
The
helicopter
was
already
fuelled
and
ready
to
go
.
The
two
men
went
about
readying
for
flight
,
with
practised
,
unspoken
efficiency
.
Twenty
minutes
after
the
first
radio
signal
,
Lawton
finished
his
pre-flight
checks
.
With
a
piercing
whine
and
a
cough
,
the
engine
caught
on
the
first
ignition
.
The
rotor
blades
began
their
increasing
chop
as
De
Vere
Green
ran
in
under
them
and
shook
hands
,
just
the
once
,
with
Lawton
.
"
Keep
your
head
down
!
"
This
was
their
time-honoured
good
luck
ritual
.
He
stood
at
the
barn
door
and
watched
the
Gazelle
finally
lift
off
,
its
own
lights
rising
up
to
slowly
mingle
with
the
stars
.
Of
those
left
behind
,
none
more
than
he
knew
the
awesome
dangers
implicit
in
the
recall
signal
from
G9
.
The
destination
of
John
Delaney
was
a
room
in
the
subterranean
complex
beneath
the
square
,
featureless
block
that
was
the
Ministry
of
Defence
,
in
Whitehall
.
His
car
,
led
by
a
police
escort
,
swung
in
past
the
craggy
statue
of
Field
Marshal
Montgomery
.
Cleared
with
the
security
guards
at
the
desk
he
went
into
the
lift
that
would
take
him
down
to
a
depth
below
the
level
of
the
Thames
.
The
area
he
was
entering
was
guarded
by
an
advanced
intruder
detection
system
which
included
thermal
sensors
,
vibration
detectors
and
infra-red
closed
circuit
television
,
all
integrated
into
a
computer
system
.
As
soon
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
fluorescent-lit
corridor
,
he
was
met
by
an
official
who
hurried
him
into
a
briefing
room
.
An
air
of
emergency
was
reflected
in
the
men
busy
at
the
large
illuminated
translucent
plot
that
dominated
the
end
of
the
room
,
at
the
messengers
disappearing
through
doors
and
at
telephones
giving
out
their
muted
urgent
calls
.
Several
men
,
navy
with
gold
braid
in
evidence
,
turned
towards
him
as
Delaney
walked
over
,
eyes
automatically
glancing
at
the
geography
and
configurations
on
the
plastic
:
Atlantic
,
beyond
the
equator
.
"
Ah
,
John
.
"
The
tight-lipped
,
sandy-haired
man
holding
out
his
hand
was
well
known
to
Delaney
.
William
Connors
had
briefed
him
many
times
in
the
past
,
yet
Delaney
even
now
,
was
unsure
of
just
where
Connors
fitted
into
the
scheme
of
things
.
But
he
accepted
it
was
all
part
of
the
deliberate
fuzzing
that
went
with
G9
.
Delaney
shook
Connors
by
the
hand
.
"
What
have
we
got
?
"
"
Come
over
here
.
"
Connors
led
him
away
from
the
others
.
Mystified
,
Delaney
,
still
trying
to
take
in
more
details
of
the
map
,
followed
.
He
waited
as
,
unusually
,
Connors
seemed
to
experience
difficulty
in
putting
the
words
he
wanted
together
.
"
It
's
a
thirty
thousand
tonne
container
ship
.
One
of
ours
.
Something
funny
's
happened
.
Had
a
weird
,
rambling
emergency
call
from
the
radio
operator
.
Then
absolute
silence
.
Not
a
peep
from
her
since
.
"
Connors
paused
momentarily
and
looked
straight
at
Delaney
,
before
he
continued
.
"
She
's
dead
in
the
water
,
and
out
of
range
of
our
conventional
rescue
forces
.
We
want
you
there
to
check
out
what
the
hell
has
happened
.
And
secondly
,
we
want
you
to
stop
anybody
boarding
her
under
pretext
of
rescue
-
or
salvage
.
"
Delaney
raised
a
critical
eyebrow
:
His
one
question
went
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
,
since
he
could
think
of
no
other
reason
for
the
involvement
of
G9
.
"
Cargo
?
"
Connors
'
lips
tightened
even
further
as
he
nodded
.
"
Exactly
,
but
I
'm
afraid
it
's
on
a
need
to
know
basis
.
And
it
's
been
decided
G9
do
not
need
to
know
.
Nor
for
that
matter
do
I.
"
Delaney
,
searching
in
his
pocket
for
his
pipe
,
shrugged
.
That
sort
of
thing
was
n't
unusual
.
It
helped
if
you
got
caught
to
know
as
little
as
possible
.
"
Unfortunately
,
the
nearest
surface
units
are
elements
of
the
Red
Navy
,
"
Connors
continued
,
"
and
to
complicate
matters
they
've
got
a
sub
even
closer
,
capable
of
reaching
the
area
sometime
after
dawn
.
We
know
it
's
already
heading
that
way
.
Apart
from
our
Nimrods
,
there
has
been
at
least
one
overflight
by
a
Tupolev

He
gestured
towards
the
situation
map
,
almost
apologetically
.
"
Nasty

fast

"
Delaney
was
puzzled
.
"
Why
G9
?
"
he
asked
.
"
If
you
need
an
instant
military
presence
,
why
not
the
marines

The
SBS

love

one

Connors
shook
his
head
.
"
It
's
not
that
simple

it

Delaney
sucked
thoughtfully
on
his
empty
pipe
.
G9
was
designated
civilian
-
on
its
own
if
anything
went
wrong
.
They
were
used
to
clean
up
any
unpleasant
incidents
from
which
HM
Government
needed
to
distance
itself
.
And
the
Americans

was
funded
jointly

do
then

"
Connors
gave
a
sympathetic
shrug
;
but
it
was
a
steely
look
.
"
Simply
blow
it
out
of
the
water

he
said
.
Delaney
's
eyebrows
shot
upwards
.
"

"
A
ghost
of
a
smile
,
without
humour
,
flitted
over
Connors
'
face
as
he
slapped
Delaney
on
the
back
.
"

clouded

Connors
splayed
out
some
large
black
and
whites
on
a
side
bench
.
Delaney
bent
over
them
,
adjusting
a
lamp
and
using
a
magnifying
glass
.

Delaney
found
himself
looking
at
a
cargo
vessel
with
a
very
high
superstructure
three-quarters
aft
.
Each
side
of
the
funnel
was
a
lifeboat
,
and
at
the
stern
was
a
stores
davit
and
capstan
.
Running
forward
were
a
series
of
derricks
.
The
bow
was
bulbous
.
There
was
no
sign
of
life
on
the
deck
between
the
stacked
containers
.
She
looked
enormous

He
examined
several
photographs
in
shades
of
green
,
obviously
taken
after
nightfall
with
a
light
intensifying
lens

The
greenish
hue
added
to
the
mystery
,
making
Titron
look
like
a
ghost
ship

Delaney
lowered
the
last
photograph

cigarette

Connors

intently
through
the
smoke

as
he
reached
out
and
switched
on
a
tape

There
was
a

Somewhere
in

a

Delaney

Definitely
not

"
Thanking
him
,
Delaney
and
Connors
walked
over
to
the
main
plot
.
"
Do
the
radio
people
think
it

Delaney
asked

Connors
shook
his
head
.
"
Just

When
they
reached
the
plot
,
a
man
wearing
earphones
turned
to
Connors
,
slipped
off
the
headset
,
allowing
it
to
rest
around

appeared
to
have

each
other

Grimly
Delaney
slipped
the
pipe
back
into

pocket
and
nodded
.

"
The
C130
Hercules
of
RAF
Transport
Command
,
markings
hurriedly
painted
out
,
stood
near
the
end
of
the
runway
,
its
engines
running
up
as
a
car
swung
in
through
the
raised
barrier
,
and
past
the
RAF
Regiment
guard
.
It
drove
swiftly
round
the
perimeter
and
pulled
in
behind
the
"
plane
,
its
ramp
down
,
cavernous
interior
gaping
wide
.
In
the
dimly-lit
interior
,
Delaney
could
see
crew
members
moving
around
,
and
the
bulky
outline
of
some
pieces
of
equipment
,
inflatable
dinghy
packs
and
harness
.
And
some
of
those
shadowy
figures
were
men
of
his
group
.
Three
had
come
to
G9
via
the
SAS
.
Two
from
the
Marines
equivalent
,
the
Special
Boat
Service
.
Anderson
was
unique
,
brought
in
to
fill
two
vital
functions
:
the
need
for
a
medic
,
and
the
need
to
give
G9
something
special
,
some
angle
that
would
disguise
its
true
nature
,
an
extraordinary
elite
fighting
group
trained
for
any
emergency
.
Each
of
them
for
their
own
private
reason
needed
to
live
with
death
at
their
shoulder
.
Delaney
had
,
since
his
young
wife
,
Pam
,
who
always
worried
stiff
at
his
parachuting
,
had
died
underneath
a
juggernaut
,
with
the
son
she
would
have
given
life
to
in
one
month
's
time
.
He
stepped
from
the
car
and
turned
to
slam
the
door
.
Connors
nodded
,
his
voice
lost
in
the
noise
from
the
Hercules
.
"
Good
luck
"
were
the
words
his
lips
formed
.
But
Delaney
,
fleetingly
,
as
he
slammed
the
door
,
saw
something
in
Connors
'
eyes
.
Guilt
?
Had
Connors
told
him
everything
?
Or
was
he
holding
something
back
?
The
car
gunned
away
.
Delaney
stood
for
a
second
looking
after
it
.
Then
he
shrugged
,
and
made
his
way
towards
the
aircraft
.
The
piercing
whine
of
the
C130
's
four
Allison
turbo
props
rose
even
higher
,
hurting
his
ears
,
the
air
stinking
with
the
smell
of
burnt
kerosene
,
the
hot
moist
gases
buffeting
and
pulling
at
his
clothes
.
He
ran
up
the
ramp
,
the
sergeant
liftmaster
activating
the
hydraulics
even
before
he
had
set
loot
on
it
.
Delaney
stood
,
watching
the
hatch
close
up
,
with
the
last
view
of
the
car
headlights
turning
away
towards
the
main
building
and
the
control
tower
.
As
soon
as
the
hull
was
sealed
,
the
liftmaster
spoke
into
his
intercom
.
Immediately
the
engine
noise
grew
even
louder
,
drowning
out
the
sound
of
Delaney
's
own
voice
as
he
shouted
an
acknowledgement
to
the
sergeant
and
settled
down
in
the
nearest
side
seat
,
strapping
himself
in
.
The
fuselage
vibrated
,
the
interior
lights
flickered
and
dimmed
;
and
then
with
a
lurch
they
began
to
roll
,
bumping
and
jarring
on
the
sectional
concrete
.
Half
a
minute
later
the
airframe
gave
one
final
creak
and
his
stomach
fell
away
as
the
Hercules
lifted
off
,
whining
into
the
night
sky
.
It
finally
came
home
then
to
Delaney
what
they
were
about
to
do
in
several
hours
'
time
.
The
last
occasion
he
had
parachuted
into
the
sea
,
at
night
,
operationally
,
had
been
off
South
Georgia
.
As
the
floor
levelled
off
the
lights
flickered
and
came
up
,
the
engine
noise
settling
down
to
a
steady
background
roar
.
Delaney
unbuckled
his
webbing
and
stood
up
,
picking
his
way
forward
past
the
life
rafts
racked
ready
for
the
drop
.
Up
in
the
forward
end
,
behind
the
bulkhead
,
sat
the
five
other
members
of
G9
,
already
dressed
in
thick
Navy
issue
pullovers
and
fatigues
.
Theodore
Lawton
,
leader
of
the
second
stick
of
three
,
greeted
Delaney
matter-of-factly
.
"
Good
evening
,
John
.
"
Delaney
shook
Lawton
by
the
hand
,
and
nodded
at
the
other
faces
,
regarding
them
levelly
.
Eugene
Forster
had
a
quizzical
smile
playing
around
his
mouth
.
Barry
Silk
was
eager
and
expectant
.
Martin
Grant
,
absolutely
placid
.
Only
Doctor
Anderson
looked
grim
,
face
drawn
and
pale
.
Delaney
settled
down
beside
Lawton
.
"
All
the
equipment
aboard
?
No
hitches
?
"
Lawton
nodded
.
He
had
been
in
radio
contact
with
Delaney
during
the
latter
's
journey
down
from
the
MOD
to
Brize
Norton
.
They
all
knew
that
it
was
a
night
drop
into
the
ocean
.
Nothing
more
.
He
began
to
brief
them
.
Silk
looked
disappointed
and
scratched
away
at
his
pock-marked
face
.
"
No
sign
of
life
,
you
say
?
"
Delaney
shook
his
head
,
knowing
that
for
Silk
nothing
alive
meant
nothing
to
kill
.
Eugene
Forster
lit
a
cheroot
.
"
Our
very
own
Marie
Celeste
,
eh
?
Interesting
.
"
"
It
's
a
holding
operation
,
"
Delaney
summed
up
briskly
,
"
more
than
anything
.
All
we
have
to
do
is
get
in
and
establish
a
bridgehead
,
so
to
speak
.
The
only
one
of
us
who
might
have
their
work
cut
out
is
Doctor
Anderson
-
if
we
find
a
lot
of
casualties
.
"
All
faces
turned
towards
the
doctor
.
Not
for
the
first
time
Delaney
looked
into
the
eyes
that
were
deep
,
infathomable
pools
of
green
,
and
at
the
copper-coloured
hair
falling
around
the
high
smooth
cheek
bones
;
at
the
small
upturned
nose
and
a
mouth
just
large
enough
to
hint
at
the
animal
sensuality
lying
dormant
beneath
the
surface
.
Dormant
?
Now
why
had
he
thought
of
that
?
The
doctor
,
when
he
had
first
seen
her
,
had
awakened
a
creature
deep
within
him
that
he
had
thought
would
sleep
for
ever
-
until
the
day
he
died
.
Its
movement
had
left
an
ache
in
his
heart
.
Maybe
the
anaesthetic
that
had
numbed
his
natural
instinct
to
a
beautiful
woman
since
Pam
's
death
was
wearing
off
.
Delaney
felt
irritated
.
"
There
's
one
other
thing
,
"
he
said
.
"
You
all
know
the
difficulties
inherent
in
getting
on
board
Titron
.
We
have
reason
to
believe
an
attempt
has
already
been
made
,
by
the
Russians
.
How
successful
they
were
we
have
no
idea
.
"
Barry
Silk
perked
up
.
"
We
take
them
out
if
they
are
aboard
,
right
?
No
holds
barred
,
and
no
shit
about
international
diplomatic
pressure
?
"
Delaney
agreed
.
"
No
flack
,
"
he
said
and
clapped
his
hands
together
,
rubbing
them
in
a
warming
motion
.
"
There
are
several
hours
to
go
.
We
've
got
an
in-flight
refuelling
schedule
before
the
drop
,
so
check
your
equipment
.
Then
get
some
rest
.
"
Delaney
tried
to
avoid
looking
at
Doctor
Nell
Anderson
as
he
went
forward
to
the
flight
deck
.
But
it
was
useless
.
He
could
not
get
over
the
fact
that
the
only
woman
who
had
come
through
the
near-impossible
screening
,
then
training
,
had
not
been
some
six
foot
Amazon
with
a
face
like
Atilla
the
Hun
-
but
a
petite
,
feminine
five
foot
three
in
her
stockinged
feet
,
who
turned
all
the
men
's
head
when
she
passed
.
A
distinct
advantage
.
And
the
enigma
did
not
end
there
.
Why
,
he
kept
asking
himself
,
did
a
woman
,
trained
in
the
art
of
healing
,
who
had
been
a
naval
medical
officer
and
not
somebody
's
wife
,
suddenly
volunteer
for
something
that
was
inevitably
going
to
be
highly
dangerous
-
and
almost
certainly
involve
her
in
killing
-
at
close
quarters
?
Her
records
were
,
of
course
,
put
at
his
disposal
.
They
were
alarmingly
sparse
.
Born
in
London
of
an
Irish
mother
and
a
Scottish
father
,
she
had
been
educated
at
a
convent
school
in
North
London
.
From
there
she
had
entered
University
College
Hospital
,
emerging
seven
years
later
with
her
medical
qualifications
.
After
appointments
in
community
service
,
she
had
joined
the
Navy
.
All
straight
forward
.
The
only
thing
that
was
to
him
suspicious
,
was
apart
from
the
normality
of
liaisons
at
the
hospital
,
there
was
no
mention
of
a
man
in
her
life
.
And
judging
from
his
own
reactions
he
knew
that
was
impossible
.
But
she
put
up
a
barrier
around
her
,
and
allowed
no
one
to
pass
.
When
she
'd
been
selected
,
and
automatically
compelled
to
leave
the
Navy
,
taking
an
appointment
at
a
civilian
hospital
,
he
'd
told
himself
that
it
was
his
duty
to
visit
her
to
see
that
she
was
settled
in
-
not
lonely
.
But
it
had
come
to
nothing
,
and
in
the
process
he
had
recognised
the
truth
behind
his
motives
.
That
he
was
attracted
to
her
.
Delaney
spent
some
twenty
minutes
with
the
captain
and
crew
in
the
red-lit
cockpit
with
its
enormous
banks
of
dials
,
before
passing
back
to
change
out
of
his
suit
and
to
check
his
own
equipment
.
Forster
and
Grant
were
asleep
.
Lawton
was
reading
Blake
by
the
light
of
a
spot
lamp
.
Silk
was
cleaning
his
Uzi
folding
stock
9
mm
machine-gun
-
the
group
's
favourite
close
quarter
weapon
,
other
than
the
knife
.
Doctor
Anderson
was
tying
her
hair
back
,
pinning
it
tightly
to
her
head
.
The
toilet
of
the
female
,
Delaney
mused
.
And
a
species
deadlier
than
the
male
.
Nell
Anderson
glanced
up
as
Delaney
came
past
,
making
his
way
to
the
pre-loaded
freight
pallets
,
the
liftmaster
,
and
his
kit
.
Very
thorough
,
she
mused
.
For
John
Delaney
checked
everything
.
Nell
finished
tightly
tucking
in
the
last
strand
of
hair
,
and
pulled
on
a
black
woollen
balaclava
before
snuggling
down
into
her
sleeping
bag
,
turning
her
face
to
the
fuselage
wall
.
Unlike
the
others
,
sleep
did
not
come
easily
to
her
before
a
job
.
They
had
had
longer
to
become
philosophical
.
More
fatalistic
.
Sleep
did
n't
come
easily
when
she
was
at
home
,
or
rather
in
the
room
at
the
hospital
.
And
before
that
a
succession
of
rooms
.
Home
?
She
'd
never
known
a
true
home
.
Not
that
her
father
and
mother
had
divorced
.
They
had
just
simply
and
totally
fallen
out
of
love
with
each
other
,
and
like
the
devout
Catholics
they
were
,
carried
on
as
a
pretence
.
So
she
had
grown
up
in
a
cold
,
almost
emotionally
empty
vacuum
.
If
only
they
had
fought
,
screamed
at
one
another
,
gone
their
separate
ways
,
even
had
lovers
-
anything
but
the
sterility
of
it
all
,
a
sterility
that
had
finally
been
injected
into
everything
they
touched
.
Nell
laid
her
cheek
on
her
hands
,
held
together
as
if
in
prayer
,
forming
a
pillow
.
At
school
,
compensating
,
she
had
worked
and
worked
and
worked
,
so
much
so
that
she
had
finally
made
the
two
A's
and
a
B
necessary
for
medicine
in
her
A
levels
.
It
was
to
be
the
key
.
The
way
out
.
And
then
in
the
clinical
years
,
the
disillusion
,
the
suffering
,
the
unfairness
,
the
dying
,
the
inevitability
of
it
all
.
Growing
old
,
the
process
of
decay
had
eroded
into
her
one
reaming
confidence
.
Her
youth
.
Now
,
Nell
could
not
conceive
of
love
between
a
man
and
a
woman
,
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
ageing
.
Trapped
in
her
own
loneliness
,
suicide
had
begun
to
dominate
her
thoughts
.
As
a
doctor
it
would
have
been
so
easy
,
and
that
very
easiness
,
not
her
by
now
nominal
Catholicism
,
had
held
her
back
,
temporarily
,
from
what
she
knew
would
be
inevitable
one
day
-
before
she
was
forty
.
She
could
imagine
the
coroner
's
disinterested
voice
.
"
-
overdose
while
in
a
depressed
state
-
balance
of
mind
disturbed
.
"
Then
,
while
a
Navy
surgeon
lieutenant
-
she
liked
the
sport
and
a
contract
that
would
last
nicely
into
her
forties
-
had
come
the
memoranda
.
With
its
hints
of
dangerous
work
and
high
selectivity
it
had
seemed
like
nature
's
way
.
The
survival
of
the
fittest
.
Except
that
she
would
not
survive
.
Trained
as
they
were
,
the
psychiatrists
on
the
screening
tests
had
failed
to
scratch
the
surface
of
her
most
secret
place
;
had
failed
to
detect
the
urge
to
self-destruction
which
would
automatically
bar
her
from
G9
,
as
it
did
in
the
SAS
and
SBS
.
In
the
steady
,
stupefying
roar
of
the
Hercules
,
she
drifted
into
an
area
that
was
not
sleep
,
yet
not
awake
,
a
sort
of
limbo
where
she
could
direct
her
thoughts
-
as
in
a
dream
.
Sex
?
She
was
not
afraid
of
it
.
She
had
slept
with
three
men
in
her
life
.
It
had
nothing
to
do
with
giving
herself
.
John
Delaney
's
face
came
into
the
dream
.
His
interest
in
her
had
been
obvious
,
and
because
of
that
she
had
discouraged
it
.
Somehow
he
made
her
feel
uneasy
.
There
was
something
about
Delaney
,
something
indefinable
,
that
worried
her
.
His
almost
too
handsome
face
,
for
her
taste
,
that
is
,
was
saved
by
the
warmth
of
his
eyes
,
though
at
times
they
could
become
frightening
.
Then
they
were
hard
,
cold
,
merciless
windows
into
an
inner
world
of
violence
.
Instinctively
she
had
sensed
that
Delaney
would
demand
more
of
her
than
a
passing
gratification
.
She
sensed
that
he
needed
more
,
and
this
was
something
that
she
could
not
give
-
the
secret
places
of
her
mind
.
Satisfied
,
Barry
Silk
laid
the
last
item
of
his
equipment
lovingly
down
,
almost
as
if
for
a
kit
inspection
.
He
checked
his
watch
.
Another
three
hours
.
He
lay
back
,
resting
his
head
on
his
hands
that
were
clasped
behind
him
,
closing
his
eyes
even
though
he
did
not
feel
like
sleep
.
He
was
making
sure
they
were
not
exposed
to
any
form
of
light
source
,
however
muted
.
When
he
worked
at
night
he
prepared
properly
,
never
allowing
his
vision
to
become
impaired
in
any
way
.
It
could
mean
the
difference
between
life
-
or
death
.
He
smiled
contentedly
.
Lawton
turned
the
page
of
his
pocket
edition
of
Blake
.
When
the
stars
threw
down
their
spears
And
water
'd
heaven
with
their
tears
Did
he
smile
his
work
to
see
?
Did
he
who
made
the
lamb
make
thee
?
Tyger
!
Tyger
!
burning
bright
In
the
forests
of
the
night
,
What
immortal
hand
or
eye
,
Dare
frame
thy
fearful
symmetry
.
It
was
one
of
his
favourites
from
The
Songs
of
Experience
.
He
closed
the
book
and
slipped
it
into
a
polythene
bag
.
Even
now
he
did
n't
fully
know
what
was
meant
by
the
line
the
stars
threw
down
their
spears
.
And
it
did
n't
help
him
to
know
the
scholars
found
it
equally
obscure
.
The
forest
of
the
night
always
made
him
shiver
-
the
association
with
nameless
terrors
peering
at
him
through
the
jungle
of
a
Rousseau
painting
on
his
childhood
wall
.
Blake
had
meant
the
associated
darkness
to
be
the
haunts
of
man
's
errors
.
The
nightmare
side
of
his
intellect
.
He
tucked
the
polythene
bag
into
the
waterproofed
ammunition
pouch
.
His
gut
was
beginning
to
play
him
up
.
Careful
not
to
wake
the
others
,
he
made
his
way
for
the
third
time
to
the
lavatory
.
Lawton
smiled
.
They
never
had
bowel
trouble
in
the
movies
.
As
he
sat
in
a
roaring
solitary
splendour
twenty
thousand
feet
over
the
turbulent
,
endless
ocean
wastes
,
he
had
no
idea
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
poem
he
had
just
read
.
Forster
dreamed
of
a
beautiful
,
sophisticated
woman
.
Dressed
in
a
plain
blue
silk
suit
,
seamed
stockings
and
high
heels
,
she
sipped
her
champagne
,
red
lips
peeking
just
below
the
rim
of
the
net
coming
from
a
dainty
little
hat
.
Haughty
,
cold
,
and
ignoring
him
,
she
could
not
disguise
the
hunger
in
the
large
brown
eyes
behind
the
net
.
They
found
his
.
Mysteriously
they
were
alone
now
,
all
the
other
people
in
the
room
had
gone
,
with
the
breeze
gently
swirling
the
curtains
of
the
French
windows
leading
out
on
to
the
terrace
.
Slowly
he
put
down
his
glass
and
moved
towards
her
.
Defiantly
her
chin
came
up
,
challenging
him
,
warning
that
he
was
beneath
her
dignity
;
that
if
he
tried
to
hiss
her
she
would
-
He
did
n't
kiss
her
.
His
hand
went
out
and
cupped
her
breast
crudely
.
Her
eyes
blazed
with
shock
,
and
-
The
"
plane
bumped
,
rolling
Forster
roughly
to
one
side
,
catapulting
him
into
the
bleakness
of
reality
.
The
"
plane
rolled
and
shuddered
again
.
Forster
hauled
himself
to
his
feet
,
clinging
to
the
sides
and
overhead
rails
for
support
as
he
picked
his
way
over
to
Delaney
.
Seat
belt
signs
were
flashing
everywhere
.
"
What
's
this
,
then
?
I
thought
you
said
the
weather
report
indicated
gale
conditions
after
dawn
.
"
Delaney
nodded
.
"
They
did
,
"
he
affirmed
.
"
I
'm
going
to
check
with
the
pilot
.
Get
everybody
ready
.
We
're
less
than
forty
minutes
out
now
.
"
As
he
entered
the
cockpit
,
the
pilot
looked
worriedly
over
his
shoulder
.
"
Bad
turbulence
.
We
seem
to
have
run
right
into
it
.
"
Delaney
settled
on
to
his
haunches
between
the
two
seats
,
and
hung
on
grimly
.
"
What
is
it
like
at
the
DZ
?
"
The
pilot
shook
his
head
.
"
Ca
n't
be
good
.
I
take
it
you
'll
want
to
call
the
Big
House
?
"
"
The
MOD
communications
centre
?
Yes
.
"
Tight-lipped
,
Delaney
nodded
,
and
moved
over
to
the
radio
desk
.
The
operator
's
face
was
screwed
up
in
concentration
,
one
hand
clamped
to
his
left
ear
plug
as
he
manipulated
the
dials
of
the
set
.
"
We
're
getting
a
lot
of
interference
,
"
he
said
.
"
They
're
barely
audible
.
"
Delaney
patiently
waited
while
the
operator
re-established
the
link
.
Then
he
spoke
into
a
reserve
speaker
,
using
the
designated
call
for
the
operation
.
His
ears
were
filled
with
a
great
roaring
,
a
voice
only
just
discernible
,
but
unintelligible
,
in
its
midst
.
He
tried
several
times
.
But
it
was
useless
.
Finally
,
the
operator
pulled
out
a
small
metal
box
from
a
rack
underneath
his
desk
,
deftly
flipped
back
the
lid
and
plugged
in
the
connection
.
"
Nothing
for
it
but
to
try
this
.
"
He
began
tapping
out
his
identification
in
morse
code
.
It
took
five
minutes
to
establish
the
link
,
and
for
the
operator
to
get
out
Delaney
's
short
message
requesting
an
abort
due
to
extreme
winds
in
the
drop
zone
.
The
signal
was
acknowledged
and
they
were
advised
to
hold
.
Delaney
steadied
himself
as
the
"
plane
lurched
.
The
pilot
glanced
back
at
him
.
"
They
ca
n't
let
you
go
down
in
this
,
"
he
said
with
concern
.
"
It
would
be
suicide
.
"
The
co-pilot
shook
his
head
.
"
Funny
that
the
met
people
should
get
it
so
wrong
.
"
Outside
the
flight
deck
,
a
wisp
of
white
flicked
past
the
black
window
.
Why
did
Delaney
suddenly
find
he
was
suspicious
about
the
meteorological
report
?
It
took
nearly
five
minutes
before
Delaney
,
wearing
a
second
set
of
earphones
,
looked
up
sharply
to
make
sure
that
the
radioman
,
swearing
at
the
weird
interference
,
could
hear
the
stream
of
dots
and
dashes
coming
in
.
De-coded
,
the
operator
swung
on
his
seat
to
face
him
.
But
Delaney
could
already
read
the
answer
in
the
grim
,
red-lit
face
.
"
The
message
is
"
Albatross
"
,
sir
.
"
It
was
the
no-abort
,
go
at
any
cost
signal
.
Delaney
made
his
way
through
the
crew
door
into
the
cavernous
section
of
the
C130
that
gave
it
its
friendly
nick-name
of
Fat
Albert
.
The
others
were
waiting
expectantly
,
five
subhuman
looking
creatures
encased
in
pitch
black
rubber
wet
suits
with
continuous
flipper-like
boots
,
and
hoods
that
formed
an
evil-looking
cowl
around
faces
streaked
with
black
camouflage
paint
.
"
Well
?
"
Lawton
spoke
for
all
of
them
.
"
It
's
go
,
"
Delaney
said
cryptically
.
Unbelievably
,
for
a
split
second
,
he
was
sure
he
saw
a
look
of
relief
on
the
face
of
Nell
Anderson
.
Barry
Silk
immediately
carried
on
with
his
preparations
,
slipping
a
six
inch
long
knife
into
its
calf
holster
and
tagging
the
retaining
strap
.
Eugene
Forster
chuckled
-
without
humour
.
"
They
must
have
a
hell
of
a
reason
for
wanting
us
on
that
boat
.
"
The
jumpster
checked
with
the
pilot
one
last
time
on
the
inter-com
,
then
pressed
the
red
button
that
operated
the
hydraulic
system
.
The
roaring
engine
was
joined
by
another
,
high
pitched
whine
.
Slowly
the
hatch
,
like
some
huge
drawbridge
,
opened
out
,
the
wind
gusting
and
swirling
,
physically
reaching
in
for
them
.
They
stood
in
two
rows
,
hooked
up
to
the
static
lines
,
weighed
down
with
parachutes
and
air
tanks
,
waterproofed
combat
kits
,
clutching
personal
inflatable
rafts
attached
with
five
metres
of
line
to
their
belts
,
eyes
tense
behind
the
vizors
of
the
face
masks
.
The
waiting
,
the
worst
part
,
was
reaching
its
almost
unbearable
climax
.
The
first
flare
was
fired
,
dropping
away
to
explode
into
fiery
incandescence
a
thousand
feet
above
the
surface
,
a
snaking
,
burning
star
suspended
on
a
miniature
parachute
.
Delaney
,
Lawton
and
the
jumpmaster
looked
down
.
The
sea
was
etched
as
if
in
some
surrealistic
,
two
dimensional
painting
,
a
restless
scene
caught
in
an
endless
camera
flash
that
pushed
back
the
night
.
Great
grey-green
swells
moved
majestically
along
,
latticed
with
white
foam
that
spiralled
and
blew
from
the
crests
into
the
blackness
:
a
cold
,
frightening
,
endless
waste
of
water
.
The
jumpmaster
could
not
contain
himself
.
"
Rather
you
than
me
,
"
he
said
with
irony
.
The
Hercules
banked
,
drew
away
from
the
pool
of
light
,
then
back
into
the
merciful
,
all
concealing
blackness
.
Delaney
stirred
himself
.
"
Right
.
We
go
on
the
next
pass
.
"
The
"
plane
lumbered
around
,
came
back
into
the
wind
,
and
began
its
second
run
in
over
the
target
zone
.
Delaney
turned
to
the
group
.
"
Good
luck
,
"
he
called
,
and
found
himself
looking
at
Nell
.
Apart
from
her
shortness
she
was
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
others
,
except
for
the
largeness
of
her
green
eyes
.
They
seemed
to
be
gleaming
behind
the
glass
.
Anticipation
?
The
Hercules
came
in
dangerously
low
for
a
drop
,
just
below
five
hundred
feet
,
on
Delaney
's
orders
,
to
ensure
the
minimum
dispersion
of
the
stick
over
the
DZ
.
The
dispatcher
raised
his
arm
,
watching
the
red
bulb
above
his
head
.
Somewhere
below
another
flare
exploded
,
its
fresh
glare
lighting
up
in
stark
relief
the
yawning
edge
of
the
aircraft
.
They
waited
-
waited
before
the
edge
that
could
lead
to
eternity
.
The
red
light
became
green
.
The
dispatcher
's
arm
fell
.
One
after
the
other
the
pallets
with
the
self-inflating
assault
boats
disappeared
,
tipping
forward
out
into
the
night
,
static
lines
ripping
and
jerking
,
the
snap
of
the
opening
canopies
clearly
audible
above
the
roar
of
the
engine
,
the
wind
and
the
ocean
.
The
last
one
fell
away
.
"
Stand
by
.
"
The
dispatcher
counted
the
seconds
on
his
large
watch
,
then
chopped
his
arm
.
"
Go
!
"
One
after
the
other
,
on
the
run
,
and
without
hesitation
,
they
took
the
fatal
one
step
into
the
night
.
When
the
last
figure
had
gone
,
the
liftmaster
stabbed
at
the
button
operating
the
ramp
.
The
hydraulics
gave
out
their
whine
as
he
joined
other
crew
members
staring
down
at
the
scene
below
and
half
a
mile
back
.
More
flares
had
joined
the
others
,
illuminating
the
area
like
some
fiery
aquatic
tattoo
.
The
stick
of
parachutes
resembled
giant
wind-born
seeds
,
the
tiny
figures
dark
specks
against
the
cold
grey
sea
.
Below
each
speck
,
attacked
by
the
unseen
lines
were
the
dark
smudges
of
the
personal
life
rafts
that
would
hit
the
water
seconds
before
their
bodies
.
Even
as
they
watched
,
the
first
faint
splash
marked
an
impact
,
followed
by
others
,
and
then
the
crumpling
of
the
canopies
.
Suddenly
,
for
the
aircrew
,
the
endless
backdrop
of
the
ocean
was
violated
,
cut
by
the
appearance
from
under
the
Hercules
of
the
straight
,
man-made
lines
of
Titron
.
It
was
a
fleeting
glimpse
,
quickly
blocked
off
by
the
turning
"
plane
and
rising
ramp
.
But
it
was
enough
to
see
the
huge
steel
bulk
,
with
white
waves
licking
hungrily
up
its
vast
sides
,
and
the
grey
superstructure
topped
with
the
red
funnel
.
And
in
that
fleeting
view
,
just
as
they
flashed
over-head
,
something
bulky
on
the
deck
moved
,
back
into
the
deep
,
razor-edged
black
shadow
.
"
What
the
hell
was
that
?
"
The
liftmaster
looked
at
the
others
questioningly
.
Then
the
ship
was
lost
from
view
,
and
the
whole
weird
,
spectacular
scene
,
like
a
Dante
vision
of
a
watery
Hell
,
was
replaced
by
the
familiar
interior
of
the
ramp
.
As
soon
as
his
life
raft
boomed
into
the
sea
,
Delaney
pulled
the
quick
release
tag
and
dropped
from
his
harness
.
Elbows
in
,
hands
on
vizor
,
and
legs
bent
together
,
he
plunged
into
the
water
.
Shock
.
Cold
.
He
pulled
down
,
twisting
around
to
follow
the
line
attached
to
his
belt
.
It
was
a
dream-like
,
reversed
world
,
not
unlike
a
film
negative
.
Above
him
was
a
bright
layer
of
restless
,
silvery
white
,
the
balls
of
shining
air
rushing
from
his
escape
valve
carrying
their
own
brightness
to
the
world
of
light
above
.
Even
as
he
made
back
up
towards
it
,
half
pulling
,
half
swimming
along
the
line
leading
towards
the
rapidly
swelling
shape
that
he
knew
was
his
raft
,
the
water
he
was
in
turned
solid
,
sweeping
him
effortlessly
to
one
side
.
The
wave
must
have
been
fifteen
feet
high
.
He
broke
surface
,
his
own
breathing
hissing
and
venting
in
his
ears
.
With
powerful
leg
strokes
,
moving
just
beneath
the
surface
he
closed
with
the
raft
,
and
got
his
hand
on
the
rope
grab
handles
.
Before
he
could
do
anything
more
another
wave
lifted
him
high
into
the
foam-filled
wind
,
then
dizzyingly
dropped
him
down
into
a
hole
in
the
ocean
.
In
the
seconds
at
the
bottom
when
everything
had
steadied
,
when
there
was
n't
a
breath
of
air
,
just
a
strange
unreal
calm
,
he
rolled
over
the
edge
and
clawed
his
way
on
to
the
thin
rubber
bottom
of
the
raft
.
Like
a
ride
in
a
big
dipper
,
he
felt
the
floor
pushing
up
at
him
,
gathering
speed
as
they
climbed
a
wave
.
He
raised
his
head
,
searching
.
Near
him
was
the
nylon
canopy
of
his
"
chute
,
drifting
like
some
giant
Portuguese
man-o'-war
.
Beyond
it
was
another
raft
with
,
even
as
he
watched
,
a
dark
shape
rearing
up
out
of
the
sea
alongside
.
On
his
stomach
,
he
paddled
with
his
hands
towards
it
.
The
flares
were
hanging
low
,
only
some
twenty
seconds
of
light
remaining
.
It
was
Eugene
Forster
.
Together
they
searched
the
towering
walls
of
moving
water
.
Forster
thumped
Delaney
's
arm
and
pointed
.
One
hundred
feet
away
was
one
of
the
assault
boats
,
self-inflated
with
a
figure
already
aboard
.
They
made
towards
it
as
the
first
flare
hit
the
sea
,
continuing
to
burn
,
with
clouds
of
smoke
drifting
upwards
.
The
figure
in
the
boat
raised
an
arm
.
There
was
a
crack
and
a
hiss
,
and
a
flare
exploded
into
life
above
their
heads
.
Theodore
Lawton
ejected
the
cartridge
,
took
another
one
,
and
fired
it
over
the
side
.
Satisfied
,
he
quickly
knelt
down
,
steadied
himself
,
then
slipped
the
flare
gun
back
into
its
holder
in
the
boat
's
side
.
Nell
Anderson
heard
the
splash
as
her
raft
went
in
,
felt
the
five
metre
line
slacken
-
then
everything
went
wrong
.
She
was
reaching
for
her
quick
release
handle
as
a
solid
wall
of
water
struck
her
sideways
on
,
tumbling
her
into
the
rigging
of
the
"
chute
,
and
pulling
the
air
line
from
her
mouth
.
A
white
torrent
roared
out
in
front
of
her
face
,
blinding
,
choking
,
as
her
frenzied
kicking
legs
caught
in
the
"
chute
rigging
,
binding
them
together
.
Panic
.
Nell
Anderson
knew
she
was
seconds
from
death
,
and
that
despite
her
desire
for
it
,
the
moment
it
was
on
her
was
terrifying
in
its
violence
.
She
took
a
grip
on
herself
,
physically
pushed
back
the
dark
,
claustrophobic
horror
at
the
point
of
drowning
.
She
had
been
trained
to
survive
;
to
do
things
instinctively
.
She
could
not
die
by
giving
up
.
That
would
not
be
right
.
And
from
that
moment
she
began
to
think
clearly
,
rationally
,
and
ceased
to
struggle
.
In
the
last
second
before
the
knifing
pain
in
her
chest
forced
her
to
breath
in
water
she
found
the
dangling
mouthpiece
,
and
pushed
it
back
between
her
teeth
.
Even
as
another
rolling
hill
of
a
wave
tumbled
her
dizzyingly
further
into
the
"
chute
,
the
air
was
hissing
and
venting
in
her
breathing
system
,
easing
the
pain
,
and
delivering
her
from
the
edge
of
eternity
.
She
reached
for
the
knife
at
her
calf
,
and
began
cutting
the
rigging
binding
her
legs
.
It
took
several
minutes
,
and
then
suddenly
another
wave
pulled
the
last
line
free
,
unwinding
from
her
thigh
,
to
relinquish
its
grip
like
some
long
thin
tentacle
.
She
surfaced
beneath
the
canopy
,
dived
again
and
powered
forward
until
she
could
see
clear
water
above
.
As
Nell
Anderson
came
to
the
surface
yet
another
huge
wave
arrived
.
There
was
no
sign
of
her
raft
,
the
line
of
which
she
realised
she
had
cut
.
The
hill
of
water
lifted
her
,
giving
a
view
of
the
area
.
Away
to
the
left
a
flare
hit
the
water
,
clouds
of
smoke
rolling
over
the
surface
towards
her
.
It
still
burned
with
a
harsh
,
blinding
glare
and
through
it
she
could
see
vague
shapes
,
presumably
the
others
.
The
wave
passed
on
,
dropping
her
into
a
terrifyingly
deep
trough
,
cutting
off
all
contact
;
a
solitary
cell
of
blank
,
featureless
water
.
She
ducked
her
head
in
,
and
tried
to
go
deeper
before
making
towards
the
fallen
flare
.
Barry
Silk
hit
the
water
textbook
fashion
.
He
made
it
without
difficulty
on
to
his
raft
,
swinging
it
round
to
join
the
group
he
had
noticed
dropping
away
to
his
left
;
and
was
overturned
by
a
breaking
wave
.
There
was
no
trace
of
the
yellow
and
orange
raft
when
he
surfaced
.
And
it
did
n't
overly
worry
him
.
With
powerful
leg
strokes
he
made
for
the
assault
boat
from
which
new
flares
were
being
fired
.
Martin
Grant
's
parachute
malfunctioned
immediately
he
left
the
aircraft
.
The
peripheral
hem
blew
back
over
the
canopy
,
dividing
it
into
two
lobes
.
Last
of
his
stick
to
leave
the
C130
,
Grant
's
rate
of
descent
was
half
again
as
fast
as
the
rest
,
taking
him
past
the
others
,
and
plummeting
him
down
in
a
whirling
corkscrew
.
Desperately
he
hauled
on
the
lines
,
trying
to
pull
them
free
,
knowing
he
was
too
low
to
deploy
the
reserve
.
One
hundred
feet
up
it
snapped
into
full
canopy
.
Still
moving
fast
he
went
into
the
sea
,
his
left
leg
jerking
violently
as
the
still
unopened
life
raft
got
in
the
way
.
Excruciating
pain
stabbed
up
into
his
groin
.
It
took
all
his
willpower
to
keep
his
teeth
biting
into
the
rubber
.
The
scream
stifled
in
his
head
.
For
a
second
he
blacked
out
,
coming
to
as
something
big
rammed
into
his
back
.
Disorientated
for
a
frightening
moment
,
he
panicked
,
thinking
it
was
a
shark
.
Then
his
training
took
over
.
He
went
down
fast
,
clawing
at
the
water
with
his
hands
,
trailing
his
useless
leg
,
and
praying
there
was
no
blood
pumping
out
,
clouding
the
water
,
and
contaminating
it
with
its
smell
.
Doubled
up
he
drew
his
knife
,
eyes
behind
the
vizor
desperately
searching
the
inky
blackness
.
Then
he
was
up
to
the
silvery
layer
of
the
surface
.
Relief
.
He
knew
then
what
it
had
been
.
The
large
shape
of
one
of
the
assault
boats
was
still
forming
,
stretching
ever
further
as
he
watched
,
and
folding
out
on
itself
.
Thankfully
he
went
up
to
it
,
getting
a
grip
on
its
side
ropes
as
he
surfaced
.
Despite
the
pain
,
he
managed
to
push
up
out
of
the
water
and
roll
with
practised
efficiency
over
the
side
,
and
in
.
Thankfully
,
Grant
was
totally
unaware
of
the
large
grey
shape
that
powered
effortlessly
and
hungrily
past
,
as
his
boots
left
the
water
.
Its
age
old
pre-historic
instinct
had
brought
it
and
many
others
to
the
spot
a
day
ago
in
a
bloody
frenzy
of
feeding
.
Delaney
and
Forster
reached
Lawton
who
helped
them
one
at
a
time
into
the
boat
.
Delaney
clambered
in
last
.
"
Any
sign
of
the
others
?
"
he
asked
.
Lawton
pointed
.
"
One
of
mine
came
past
in
a
hurry
.
Went
down
with
a
bang
over
there
.
"
They
slipped
the
paddles
from
their
containing
sleeves
,
and
using
short
hard
jabs
began
moving
,
cresting
a
wave
and
plunging
down
the
other
side
,
knowing
that
whoever
it
was
would
be
in
serious
trouble
.
Nell
Anderson
could
n't
understand
it
.
The
more
she
swam
,
no
nearer
did
the
assault
boat
seem
to
get
.
There
was
nothing
more
she
could
do
but
try
again
.
Feeling
the
tiredness
and
the
coldness
creeping
into
her
body
,
she
swam
without
looking
,
putting
everything
into
the
effort
.
Finally
,
exhausted
,
she
stopped
and
looked
up
.
This
time
she
knew
why
,
seeing
on
the
top
of
the
wave
,
the
movement
of
the
man
and
paddles
.
They
were
pulling
away
from
her
.
Even
as
she
watched
they
disappeared
over
the
edge
,
leaving
her
in
a
watery
isolation
.
Almost
dispassionately
she
thought
:
I
'll
never
be
picked
up
.
Soon
,
she
would
be
left
in
the
darkness
,
in
the
middle
of
an
ocean
,
thousands
of
miles
from
anywhere
.
Coming
to
that
realisation
so
soon
after
her
panic
at
drowning
did
n't
seem
to
worry
her
as
much
as
it
should
have
done
.
But
then
,
she
'd
been
lonely
all
her
life
.
Barry
Silk
was
better
placed
.
As
soon
as
he
realised
what
was
happening
he
put
the
pressure
on
,
and
was
closing
with
them
when
he
saw
another
assault
boat
.
It
appeared
to
be
empty
.
He
changed
course
and
reached
it
,
just
as
a
hand
came
into
view
,
with
the
top
of
somebody
's
headgear
lying
inside
.
Shakily
,
Martin
Grant
raised
the
flare
gun
and
fired
.
Two
assault
boats
were
more
than
Delaney
had
dared
hope
for
.
They
'd
dropped
four
,
each
prepacked
with
a
selection
of
gear
.
Under
these
conditions
they
could
have
expected
a
higher
failure
rate
.
Barry
Silk
was
already
with
Martin
Grant
when
they
came
alongside
.
Choosing
his
moment
,
Lawton
transferred
as
Delaney
passed
a
rope
to
Grant
.
Delaney
shouted
through
the
spray
.
"
Any
sign
of
Nell
?
"
Grant
shook
his
head
.
After
he
had
clambered
across
he
searched
again
,
feeling
desperate
.
Only
an
empty
yellow
raft
was
in
sight
in
the
lit-up
area
.
It
looked
ominous
.
The
Hercules
made
another
,
much
higher
pass
,
its
whine
almost
lost
in
the
roaring
sea
.
A
sudden
boom
followed
in
its
wake
,
a
new
parachute
flare
splitting
the
night
sky
-
a
red
target
flare
.
Beneath
it
for
the
first
time
,
they
saw
Titron
,
lying
in
the
water
some
quarter
of
a
mile
away
;
a
huge
,
red-lit
steel
cliff
with
the
black
sea
boiling
pinky-white
below
.
For
a
moment
they
all
froze
,
staring
at
it
.
Silk
broke
the
silence
.
"
It
's
a
hell
of
a
size
.
"
The
rules
were
well
defined
and
clear-cut
.
Delaney
should
now
quickly
gather
all
surviving
members
of
his
force
and
make
for
the
target
,
with
no
potentially
dangerous
searches
.
It
was
accepted
.
Everyone
knew
it
.
And
Nell
was
no
exception
.
He
felt
their
eyes
on
him
.
The
target
flare
had
burst
behind
her
,
lighting
the
whole
area
with
its
fiery
red
glow
.
Nell
Anderson
stopped
,
treading
water
as
she
tried
to
work
it
out
.
She
was
between
Titron
and
the
assault
boat
which
had
been
going
away
from
it
.
But
it
would
have
to
come
back
,
passing
anywhere
in
an
area
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
either
side
.
It
would
need
only
fifty
feet
either
way
,
and
she
could
not
be
seen
.
She
waited
.
"
There
!
"
Delaney
pointed
,
having
seen
something
bobbing
in
the
water
.
As
they
got
nearer
they
could
see
it
was
some-one
,
head
and
shoulders
clearly
visible
.
It
had
to
be
Nell
.
Delaney
shouted
,
saw
her
going
under
,
and
knew
from
the
strange
lethargic
roll
as
a
wave
washed
past
,
that
something
was
desperately
wrong
.
Almost
on
top
of
Nell
,
he
snapped
his
mask
back
down
over
his
face
,
bit
on
the
breathing
tube
,
and
went
in
backwards
.
He
came
up
behind
her
,
reaching
out
as
water
washed
in
a
surface
line
over
the
glass
of
his
vizor
.
Delaney
spun
her
around
-
and
gagged
.
The
face
was
grinning
,
cheekless
,
with
an
eye
hanging
on
to
bare
bone
,
glistening
raw
meat
where
great
tooth
marks
showed
clearly
it
had
been
half
eaten
.
It
was
a
passing
glimpse
,
since
there
was
nothing
else
from
the
chest
down
,
his
pull
spinning
the
lightened
torso
around
,
almost
weightless
in
the
water
.
Forster
got
Delaney
back
into
the
boat
,
leaving
the
gruesome
remains
to
continue
on
their
grinning
journey
.
"
Jesus
Christ
!
"
Forster
breathed
out
the
profanity
.
"
Must
have
been
one
of
the
crew
.
"
Involuntarily
,
they
all
looked
towards
Titron
again
.
"
The
sooner
we
get
aboard
the
better
,
"
Lawton
said
quietly
.
Silk
was
more
pointed
.
"
The
weather
's
getting
worse
.
We
'll
have
to
leave
her
.
"
Delaney
found
he
could
n't
say
anything
.
He
simply
nodded
.
As
they
paddled
in
silence
,
Delaney
bit
back
the
rising
ache
in
his
throat
.
Why
in
God
's
name
had
he
let
Nell
Anderson
come
?
Even
allowed
her
to
join
the
unit
?
He
could
have
found
some
excuse
for
downgrading
her
.
Some
of
the
others
-
Silk
especially
-
was
against
the
inclusion
of
a
female
in
the
unit
.
But
Delaney
knew
if
he
had
refused
her
to
come
along
,
Nell
would
have
downgraded
him
.
His
body
seemed
heavy
,
let
alone
his
heart
.
She
saw
them
coming
,
yet
knew
she
could
not
intercept
them
in
time
.
There
was
only
one
thing
she
could
think
of
to
do
.
After
that
it
would
be
too
late
.
Strapped
to
her
stomach
,
low
down
,
was
the
waterproof
personal
weapon
's
bag
.
She
got
her
hands
to
it
,
unfastened
the
buckles
,
and
in
her
fumblings
,
nearly
let
it
go
.
If
she
had
it
would
have
sunk
-
instantly
.
On
her
back
now
,
bag
clear
of
the
water
,
she
began
to
unzip
it
,
trying
to
keep
it
dry
.
The
Uzi
sub-machine
gun
with
the
folding
stock
was
the
main
armament
.
It
came
clear
from
the
bag
,
her
finger
slipping
on
to
the
trigger
,
thumb
freeing
the
safety
catch
.
She
raised
the
barrel
skywards
,
and
was
tumbled
over
by
a
breaking
wave
.
The
gun
jerked
,
sent
several
rounds
into
the
air
before
it
sprayed
away
down
into
the
ocean
,
and
jammed
.
Bitter
salt
water
got
past
the
mouthpiece
,
choking
her
,
eyes
streaming
with
the
effort
of
coughing
.
Still
half
blind
,
she
tried
again
.
Nothing
happened
.
She
tried
again
.
And
again
.
Nothing
.
She
threw
it
away
,
then
fumbled
in
the
bag
,
her
hand
finding
the
solid
objects
racked
neatly
in
its
side
.
She
drew
one
out
.
Spitting
her
mouthpiece
away
she
drew
the
pin
with
her
teeth
and
lobbed
the
grenade
in
their
direction
.
The
shortened
burst
of
automatic
fire
from
Nell
's
Uzi
had
cut
into
the
night
and
was
gone
before
it
could
be
properly
assimilated
.
As
one
,
they
stopped
paddling
,
crouching
low
,
eyes
quartering
the
area
adjacent
to
their
part
of
the
boat
,
unsure
of
its
direction
.
"
What
the
hell
was
that
?
"
Forster
asked
.
"
Definitely
gunfire
,
"
Silk
observed
.
"
Russians
?
Or
whoever
's
on
Titron
?
"
Lawton
suggested
.
But
Silk
was
adamant
.
"
That
was
a
Uzi
.
"
With
a
rush
Delaney
realised
.
"
It
's
Nell
,
"
he
yelled
.
"
But
for
God
's
sake
-
which
direction
?
"
as
if
in
answer
to
his
question
,
they
heard
the
grenade
explode
;
the
water
around
it
spasmed
,
sending
a
central
jet
erupting
skywards
to
be
almost
instantly
swept
away
by
the
wind
.
But
it
was
enough
.
"
There
!
"
Forster
yelled
,
and
pointed
a
directional
finger
.
Delaney
dug
his
paddle
into
the
sea
,
urgently
.
"
Move
!
"
he
ordered
.
"
Move
!
"
Feverishly
they
attacked
the
sea
,
their
eyes
straining
for
any
sign
of
movement
in
the
red-tinged
,
black
water
.
They
were
almost
on
top
of
Nell
before
Delaney
saw
the
bobbing
head
.
"
We
've
got
her
-
thank
God
!
"
He
reached
down
,
both
hands
finding
hers
.
With
Forster
supporting
his
legs
,
Delaney
used
the
forward
motion
of
the
boat
to
haul
Nell
from
the
water
,
finally
landing
her
like
a
slippery
black
sea
creature
.
Exhausted
,
Nell
looked
up
at
Delaney
,
a
wry
smile
crossing
her
white
,
cold
face
.
"
I
do
n't
usually
accept
lifts
from
strange
men
.
"
Delaney
grinned
,
the
creases
around
his
eyes
deepening
.
"
Women
,
"
he
growled
back
in
mock
disgust
,
"
they
're
always
late
.
"
The
Hercules
made
one
more
pass
to
drop
the
second
and
final
target
flare
.
They
headed
for
Titron
.
As
it
grew
gradually
nearer
,
and
larger
,
they
soon
found
it
towering
over
them
-
a
mighty
steel
fortress
.
A
fortress
that
contained
-
what
?
The
mystery
was
in
all
of
their
thoughts
as
silently
and
grimly
they
came
alongside
.
Perhaps
a
Sleeping
Beauty
,
mused
Eugene
Forster
.
He
was
nearer
to
the
truth
than
he
could
have
ever
known
.
Only
the
sleep
was
over
.
Scanning
the
deck
railing
,
Delaney
could
see
no
movement
as
he
raised
the
pistol
grip
launcher
,
adjusting
the
length
of
burn
.
The
timing
in
the
heavy
swell
had
to
be
carefully
judged
.
As
the
boat
rammed
the
steel
plates
,
fabric
ripping
as
it
was
dragged
up
against
the
rough
barnacled
side
,
he
fired
.
With
an
almost
lazy
climb
the
solid
fuel
missile
,
grapple
irons
extending
as
it
left
the
short
barrel
,
reached
its
zenith
and
fell
back
with
a
clang
,
hooking
on
to
the
deck
railing
.
Even
as
Delaney
hauled
the
line
tight
,
with
his
Uzi
slung
across
his
back
,
he
began
to
walk
up
the
steel
wall
.
Lawton
at
the
other
end
of
the
assault
boat
fired
.
His
grapple
connected
and
he
began
to
follow
.
Before
he
reached
the
top
,
Delaney
paused
,
and
holding
with
his
legs
,
unslung
the
Uzi
and
brought
it
to
one-handed
readiness
.
At
eye
level
he
scanned
the
deck
.
The
red
light
from
the
nearly
spent
flare
threw
giant
shadows
;
black
,
impenetrable
,
utterly
concealing
a
possible
enemy
.
Lawton
joined
him
,
his
own
machine
gun
at
the
ready
.
Together
they
scaled
the
remaining
rope
,
rolling
over
the
railing
and
falling
flat
on
to
the
deck
with
practised
ease
,
short
stubby
muzzles
of
the
Uzis
weaving
and
probing
the
long
narrow
passage
.
Nothing
moved
.
Lawton
covered
as
Delaney
raised
himself
,
wriggling
forward
into
the
nearest
pocket
of
shadow
,
as
Forster
and
Silk
came
up
like
weird
,
black
sea
creatures
that
slithered
silently
over
the
rail
and
into
the
nearest
cover
of
darkness
.
Grant
brought
up
the
rear
,
using
his
arms
only
to
haul
himself
up
the
rope
.
No
commands
were
necessary
,
the
attack
already
planned
.
Delaney
moved
forward
,
keeping
to
the
side
of
the
superstructure
,
intent
on
the
stairway
leading
to
the
next
deck
,
and
finally
the
bridge
.
Only
Forster
and
Silk
followed
,
Lawton
staying
to
assist
Nell
bring
up
the
extra
combat
kit
that
they
would
now
recover
from
the
assault
boat
.
Grant
guarded
their
rear
-
the
work
assigned
to
anyone
disabled
.
They
moved
warily
,
scuttling
forward
,
overlapping
each
other
,
black
wraith-like
phantoms
moving
as
a
single
entity
,
its
rhythm
known
to
them
as
"
house-laundering
"
-
engaging
the
enemy
at
close
quarters
.
There
were
six
decks
to
the
level
of
the
wheelhouse
.
In
that
time
they
saw
no
movement
,
no
living
or
dead
person
,
no
sign
of
violence
;
nothing
,
but
the
ordered
emptiness
of
a
darkened
and
dead
ship
.
"
It
's
spooky
,
"
Forster
said
,
finally
breaking
the
silence
.
But
nobody
answered
.
They
arrived
at
the
sliding
door
entrance
to
the
bridge
.
Silk
flattened
himself
beside
the
steel
door
,
Delaney
and
Forster
priming
stun
grenades
.
The
fuses
were
six
second
ones
.
After
a
count
of
three
,
soundlessly
checked
by
Delaney
with
his
arm
,
Silk
heaved
back
on
the
door
as
they
lobbed
them
in
.
There
followed
an
intense
double
flash
,
the
explosions
sounding
like
thousand
pound
bombs
.
Anyone
inside
would
be
temporarily
blinded
,
momentarily
stunned
,
unless
they
were
trained
personnel
and
had
taken
precautions
.
But
Silk
was
already
inside
,
hunched
down
low
,
Uzi
searching
for
targets
.
Delaney
and
Forster
were
close
behind
.
In
the
cordite-reeking
interior
loomed
dim
and
unfamiliar
shapes
.
Silk
moved
very
slowly
,
deliberately
,
pausing
with
each
step
,
like
a
stalking
tiger
.
The
others
keened
themselves
for
any
sound
,
for
any
indication
of
anyone
responding
to
Silk
's
movement
-
the
clink
of
a
grenade
pin
,
the
withering
blast
of
a
machine
gun
.
Nothing
happened
.
Silk
moved
again
,
outflanked
a
control
console
,
nestling
down
beside
it
as
Delaney
took
over
the
lead
.
Delaney
was
leaving
the
cover
of
a
vent
pipe
when
it
happened
.
There
was
a
scraping
and
a
clink
.
The
short
burst
from
Silk
's
Uzi
lit
up
the
bridge
in
a
flickering
light
,
showing
its
emptiness
as
the
cat
bucked
and
disintegrated
in
a
shower
of
red
pieces
.
Even
before
its
last
twitch
they
sprang
forward
,
securing
the
room
.
Silk
guarded
the
far
door
.
Delaney
played
a
torch
around
.
Everything
was
neat
.
There
was
no
sign
of
any
devastation
or
a
struggle
,
except
where
the
pool
of
light
picked
out
the
broken
,
gutted
cat
.
"
Try
the
lights
,
"
Delaney
snapped
.
There
was
a
clicking
followed
by
Forster
's
voice
.
"
No
joy
.
Everything
is
shut
down
.
"
That
same
pool
of
light
picked
out
a
half-smoked
cigar
on
the
edge
of
an
ashtray
,
a
partly
consumed
sandwich
,
and
several
mugs
of
cold
tea
.
To
one
side
was
an
open
paperback
novel
.
"
It
's
just
as
if
they
downed
tools
and
pushed
off
,
"
Forster
remarked
.
"
No
sign
of
a
struggle
.
"
Delaney
,
taking
in
the
scene
,
nodded
.
"
Right
,
"
he
said
briskly
,
"
get
the
rest
of
our
kit
up
here
-
both
of
you
.
And
Gene
-
"
Forster
paused
in
the
doorway
.
"
Watch
it
.
We
still
do
n't
know
what
it
is
we
are
up
against
,
do
we
?
"
Delaney
waited
in
the
darkness
,
listening
to
the
wind
moaning
in
the
wireless
rigging
and
battering
on
the
window
.
The
weather
was
certainly
getting
worse
.
They
had
only
just
managed
to
get
on
the
vessel
in
time
.
As
he
gazed
out
,
down
the
enormous
length
of
the
ship
,
he
could
just
make
out
the
dark
outline
against
the
lighter
sea
,
and
the
rectangular
shapes
of
the
deck-covered
containers
.
Would
they
find
the
answer
down
there
,
he
thought
,
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
ship
?
His
own
bowel
felt
uneasy
in
the
eerie
emptiness
,
emphasised
by
the
abandoned
accoutrements
of
the
missing
crew
,
all
around
him
.
It
was
like
being
the
last
man
alive
on
earth
.
When
the
others
returned
,
bringing
the
extra
equipment
,
he
took
a
field
radio
,
stepped
outside
and
began
to
transmit
to
the
Hercules
that
was
still
circling
around
above
them
somewhere
.
Immediately
he
tuned
the
set
in
,
interference
was
enormous
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
source
was
within
Titron
itself
.
Delaney
could
hear
the
Hercules
operator
respond
-
nothing
more
.
There
was
only
one
thing
he
could
do
.
Every
few
seconds
he
transmitted
the
"
successfully
aboard
"
code
.

HERON
Nell
Anderson
looked
up
as
Delaney
entered
.
She
was
attending
to
Grant
's
leg
.
"
He
wo
n't
be
very
mobile
for
some
time
,
"
she
said
.
"
It
's
a
bad
sprain
.
"
Grant
handed
him
his
personal
transceiver
to
clip
on
to
Delaney
's
webbing
.
"
They
wo
n't
work
for
the
moment
.
Too
much
interference
.
"
In
the
captain
's
cabin
behind
the
bridge
he
found
the
ship
's
log
.
It
conveyed
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
.
It
ended
abruptly
the
day
before
the
distress
call
.
"
Nothing
there
,
"
he
said
,
closing
the
book
.
Delaney
turned
aside
,
and
was
about
to
ask
Forster
if
he
'd
found
the
cargo
manifest
,
when
Nell
,
who
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
,
spoke
.
"
Does
n't
it
strike
you
as
odd
?
"
Puzzled
,
he
looked
back
at
her
.
"
What
?
"
She
thumped
the
discarded
log
book
with
the
back
of
her
hand
.
"
Titron
does
n't
appear
to
have
been
in
port
for
over
two
years
.
Like
a
latter-day
Flying
Dutchman
.
"
Delaney
took
the
book
from
her
and
scrutinised
it
more
carefully
.
It
was
true
.
The
ship
had
been
refuelled
and
re-provisioned
at
sea
by
fleet
auxiliaries
.
Nell
spoke
his
thoughts
out
loud
as
their
eyes
met
.
"
There
must
have
been
a
reason
for
it
,
like
not
wanting
anyone
to
know
what
was
being
carried
aboard
Titron
.
"
Delaney
finally
nailed
it
.
"
Because
what
was
on
board
was
too
dangerous
to
be
anywhere
near
land
.
Had
to
be
kept
thousands
of
miles
out
in
the
ocean
.
"
They
left
Lawton
with
Grant
to
guard
the
bridge
area
,
and
set
about
a
systematic
search
of
the
superstructure
.
"
Funny
,
but
the
radio
shack
is
usually
on
this
deck
,
"
Forster
remarked
at
the
end
of
the
room
for
these
extra
quarters
.
Seems
very
peculiar
,
though
.
"
But
as
they
descended
to
the
next
deck
,
then
to
the
one
below
,
the
reason
became
obvious
.
There
was
row
upon
row
of
rooms
and
carpeted
corridors
,
revealed
by
their
tensely-held
torches
,
the
ghostly
yellow
pools
of
light
allowing
only
the
objects
that
slid
in
and
out
of
them
to
be
examined
.
The
blackness
closed
around
,
obscuring
any
lurking
danger
.
The
rooms
were
well
furnished
,
many
with
books
and
hi-fi
equipment
.
Everywhere
there
was
evidence
of
abandoned
normality
as
though
everyone
had
put
down
what
they
had
been
doing
,
and
then
simply
vanished
;
half
finished
cups
of
coffee
,
dishevelled
beds
,
games
of
scrabble
and
cards
laid
out
,
play
suspended
.
In
fact
,
life
itself
suspended
.
Forster
shone
his
torch
on
to
a
stationary
music
turntable
.
"
Scarlatti
and
Bach
!
"
he
emphasised
.
"
Not
perhaps
the
normal
taste
you
might
expect
from
a
crew
member
.
"
Nell
was
at
a
bookshelf
,
reading
out
titles
as
the
pool
of
light
passed
over
the
volumes
.
"

Years

"
They
discovered
three
whole
decks
taken
up
by
cabins
alone
,
with
a
fourth
containing
a
large
dining
area
and
kitchens
.
Delaney
shook
his
head
,
unbelievingly
.
"
A
normal
crew
for
this
sort
of
ship
would
be
about
thirty-five
,
forty
at
the
most
.
Yet
there
is
cabin
space
and
facilities
for
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
.
Something
in
the
region
of
ninety
,
or
a
hundred
plus
.
And
that
on
top
of
the
crew

"
Unconvincingly
,
Nell
made
an
observation
.
"
Passengers
,
perhaps
?
Modern
ships
make
money
wherever
they
can
.
"
Forster
was
adamant
.
"
These
cabins
had
permanent
occupants
.
All
their
own
bits
and
pieces
.
And
they
seem
to
have
been
scientists

one
sort

another

Delaney
ran
his
finger
round
the
edge
of
his
wet
suit
face
cowl
.
"
Now
let's
get
this
straight
.
What

one
hundred
scientists
be
doing
out
here

on
a
permanent
basis
?
"
It
was
obvious
.
Yet
Connors
had
n't
even
hinted
at
it
.
Was
that
the
reason
,
Delaney
thought
,
for
that
look
in
his
eye
.
Was
he
holding
back
on
something
?
If
so
,
the
next
question
was
even
more
important
.
"
What
had
they
been
working
on
?
"
Delaney
wanted
to
hear
someone
else
say
it
.
Nell
obliged
on
both
counts
.
"
Working
obviously
on
a
project

some
sort

"
A
wave
passed
,
so
high
that
its
spray
burst
against
a
side
porthole
as
they
stared
at
each
other
.
"
Yes
,
"
Delaney
finally
said
,
hanging
on
to
a
handle
to
steady
himself
,
"

were
they
working
on

"
Silk
frowned
.
"
What
do
you
mean
by
where
?
"
Forster
explained
.
"
Were
they
just
staying
in
their
cabins
,
working
in
isolation
and
without
equipment
,
which
does
n't
seem
likely
,
or
what
other
part
of
the
ship
did
they
meet
in
?
"
Silk
's
pock-marked
face
was
caught
in
the
upward
glare
of
his
torch
,
giving
it
a
frightening
,
even
demonic
look
,
under
the
black
cowl
.
"
Must
be
in
the
hold
.
"
They
left
the
superstructure
and
moved
slowly
and
carefully
along
the
starlit
open
deck
,
the
increasing
wind
hammering
and
buffeting
at
their
bodies
.
Before
they
reached
the
towering
stack
of
containers
,
between
which
ran
innumerable
alleyways
where
no
faint
light
penetrated
,
they
came
upon
a
series
of
deck
hatches
.
Quickly
they
unfastened
the
catches
,
lifted
the
heavy
doors
,
and
shone
their
torches
down
.
A
ladder
led
into
a
huge
,
cavernous
interior
to
reveal
amazing
sight
.
It
was
as
if
they
were
in
an
aircraft
flying
over
a
modern
city
.
From
a
thick
layer
of
cloud
projected
the
tops
of
tall
buildings
.
Skyscrapers
.
The
cloud
was
a
white
,
heavier-than-air
gas
,
that
had
formed
a
definite
surface
layer
;
the
buildings
were
the
tops
of
stacked
containers
.
Forster
whistled
.
"

I
wonder

Delaney
stood
back
.
"

They
donned
the
standard

respirators
from
the
assault
boat
kit

With
large
eye-pieces

side
muzzles

built
into
the
dome

looked

came

them

swung
a
foot
on
to
the
ladder

They
all
knew

some
gases
were
skin
absorbable

Delaney
's
weird
,
outlandish
figure
climbed
slowly
and
clumsily
down
,
rung
by
rung
.
At
the
surface
of
the
milky-looking
gas
he
paused
,
and
looked
back
up
at
the
three
masked
faces
,
conscious
all
the
while
of
the
increasing
rhythm
of
his
breathing
.
There
could
be
no
telling
if
his
mask
would
be
effective
until
it
was
too
late

there
was
no
other
way
to
find
out
.
Reflexly
,
he
took
a
deep
breath
,
and
climbed
down
further
.
Anxiously
,
they
waited
as
Delaney
's
black
figure
lowered
itself
into
the
fog
,
and
was
lost
,
bit
by
bit
,
from
view
,
suggesting
a
primordial
creature
descending
into
a
tropical
,
mist-covered
swamp
.
They
could
see
his
headlight
beam
picked
out
beneath
the
gas
layer
,
as
it
swept
the
area
,
then
lifting
up
towards
them
like
a
searchlight
cutting
through
cloud
.
Inside
the
cloud
it
was
not
so
dense
,
and
large
particles
,
like
wisps
of
white
tissue
,
drifted
in
the
column
of
brightness
of
the
beam
of
his
headlight
.
He
was
standing
now
on
the
steel
floor
,
the
corner
of
the
first
container
some
twenty
feet
away
.
Delaney
sank
down
and
waited
,
all
the
while
listening
to
his
breathing
,
and
wondering
.
The
power
of
the
mind
-
of
the
terrified
mind
-
over
the
body
,
he
mused
.
Five
minutes
later
he
had
gone
in
,
his
grotesquely
helmeted
head
rose
from
the
layer
of
mist
,
to
wave
them
down
.
The
rows
and
rows
of
containers
,
stacked
three
,
four
and
five
high
,
were
laid
out
in
neat
uniformity
,
forming
a
maze
of
passageways
.
Delaney
tried
his
transceiver
.
Within
the
confines
of
the
steel
hull
the
interference
was
less
.
He
adjusted
the
earpiece
underneath
his
cowl
.
"
If
anybody
feels
funny
-
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
-
report
immediately
.
"
Silk
's
voice
,
metallic
,
distorted
,
crackled
in
his
ear
.
"
Take
a
hell
of
a
time
to
search
all
these
,
wo
n't
it
?
"
Lawton
loomed
up
and
stood
beside
him
.
"
Ca
n't
see
your
laboratory
.
"
Delaney
pointed
at
one
of
two
major
alleyways
.
"
Could
be
at
the
other
end
.
You
take
Silk
,
and
go
that
way
.
I
'll
go
with
Forster
.
We
'll
meet
at
the
other
end
.
"
Lawton
nodded
,
the
light
reflecting
on
his
eyepiece
.
As
the
two
figures
moved
away
,
the
searching
beams
were
slowly
reduced
by
the
fog
until
just
the
sources
glowed
yellow
.
Then
nothingness
.
Delaney
signalled
Forster
to
follow
and
made
his
way
down
the
other
corridor
.
Unlike
the
passageways
in
the
superstructure
the
area
they
were
moving
down
was
more
unnerving
,
especially
in
the
reduced
visibility
.
Above
them
there
was
no
roof
,
just
the
swirling
gas
with
,
in
places
,
shorter
stacking
giving
ledges
.
Every
thirty
feet
or
so
there
was
a
crossway
,
a
dark
corner
to
be
approached
warily
.
The
storm
outside
was
beginning
to
rage
,
the
steel
floor
rising
and
falling
,
and
the
containers
creaking
uneasily
.
The
blackness
was
absolute
beyond
their
beams
.
Forster
paused
,
caught
Delaney
by
the
arm
,
and
pointed
.
"
Look
.
"
On
the
side
of
the
nearest
container
was
a
skull
and
crossbones
.
Delaney
added
his
own
light
beam
.
Serial
numbers
followed
.
Nothing
more
.
"
What
did
they
say
the
cargo
was
?
"
Forster
asked
,
his
voice
metallic
.
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
They
did
n't
,
"
he
said
ironically
.
They
moved
on
,
down
the
cathedral-like
space
,
soaring
columns
that
dwarfed
them
disappearing
into
the
swirling
mist
.
In
the
echoing
corridors
the
booming
of
the
heavy
sea
formed
a
constant
background
.
Inside
the
mask
,
Delaney
began
to
sweat
.
It
was
hot
and
clammy
,
accentuated
by
the
constant
pain
of
keeping
his
body
at
critical
pitch
,
ready
for
instant
action
.
It
seemed
to
go
on
for
ever
,
until
the
far-off
staccato
bursts
of
a
Uzi
cut
into
the
surrealistic
scene
like
a
surgeon
's
knife
.
They
froze
,
listening
as
another
burst
followed
the
first
.
Swiftly
,
Forster
and
Delaney
moved
into
action
.
They
took
the
nearest
passage
in
the
same
direction
,
snapping
off
the
torches
and
moving
by
touch
alone
,
eyes
straining
in
the
swirling
gas
,
tensed
for
the
figures
that
could
be
the
fleeing
enemy
-
or
Lawton
and
Silk
falling
back
.
Confusion
.
It
had
killed
more
than
one
of
Delaney
's
friends
,
in
a
smoke
and
gas-filled
embassy
room
;
and
a
night
time
brush
in
the
Falklands
-
a
tragic
clash
of
SAS
and
SBS
.
Out
of
the
fog
came
a
figure
in
black
.
Delaney
's
Uzi
zeroed
in
,
pressure
increased
on
the
trigger
.
In
the
nick
of
time
he
saw
the
yellow
triangular
patch
on
the
shoulder
.
It
was
Lawton
.
Delaney
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
"
Something
-
"
Lawton
managed
breathlessly
,
"
-
came
this
way
-
did
n't
you
see
it
?
"
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
No
.
Where
's
Silk
?
"
"
Trying
to
outflank
it
,
I
expect
.
"
Frustrated
,
Delaney
shook
Lawton
by
the
arm
.
"
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
"
Behind
the
mask
,
Lawton
looked
grey
,
his
face
pinched
and
hollow-eyed
.
"
Only
saw
a
dim
outline
,
really
.
Huge
man

seemed
over
ten
feet
tall

Must
have
been
a
shadow

-
"
Before
he
could
say
more
Delaney
's
head
jerked
as
the
transceiver
speaker
behind
his
ear
roared
with
static
-
and
a
scream
.
They
all
heard
it
,
from
their
radios
,
from
the
echoing
corridors
,
followed
by
a
long
burst
from
a
Uzi
that
ended
in
a
muffled
slowing
,
as
though
it
had
been
smothered
to
a
halt
.
But
the
scream
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
,
rooting
them
to
the
spot
.
When
it
gurgled
and
died
it
left
a
silence
deeper
than
before
.
Forster
found
his
voice
.
"
Christ
Almighty
!
That
was
Silk
.

Delaney
,
moving
fast
,
snapped
on
his
torch
.
"
This
way
.
"
With
their
combined
torches
flooding
the
corridor
with
light
they
moved
fast
and
instinctively
.
"
There
!
"
Lawton
saw
it
first
.
Black
,
wet
patches
and
something
twisted
lying
in
the
midst
of
it
.
They
knew
without
any
shadow
of
doubt
what
the
patches
were
.
As
they
drew
closer
,
they
could
see
that
the
sides
of
the
surrounding
containers
were
covered
with
a
gleaming
wetness
,
spattered
to
a
height
a
few
feet
above
their
heads
.
It
was
blood
.
As
they
stood
shining
their
torches
down
on
the
twisted
bits
of
metal
,
they
saw
it
was
the
mangled
remains
of
a
Uzi
.
And
they
knew
then
where
the
blood
had
come
from
.
From
Silk
.
Forster
's
voice
was
incredulous
as
he
swung
his
torch
around
in
a
wide
arc
.
"
What
the
hell
has
happened
to
him
?
"
Grimy
,
Delaney
touched
the
twisted
metal
barrel
of
the
Uzi
with
his
foot
.
"
More
to
the
point
,
what
man
has
the
strength
to
do
this
?
"
His
eyes
found
those
of
Lawton
's
.
The
man
was
tough
.
He
would
n't
have
been
a
part
of
G9
otherwise
.
Yet
in
those
eyes
he
could
see
fear
.
Fundamental
,
animal
fear
.
They
searched
for
over
an
hour
,
following
at
first
some
vague
footprints
in
the
smudged
,
dark
liquid
.
But
they
petered
out
in
the
maze
of
corridors
.
There
was
no
trace
of
Silk
.
No
response
from
his
two-way
radio

was
restless

crossed

wheelhouse

turned
from

rain
trickling
down
the
window

"
Nell
said
,
looking
drawn
,
tired
,
with
dark
rings
forming
under
her
eyes
.
Delaney
remembered
again
that
look
in
Connors
'
eye
;
and
knew
Nell
was
right
.
But
he
said
nothing
,
and
as
he
led
the
way
,
Forster
followed
him
.
It
was
slow
work
,
moving
all
the
time
with
extreme
caution
,
just
the
two
of
them
,
their
beams
of
light
,
the
ever-present
blackness
,
and
the
half-seen
outlines
just
beyond
the
light
.
They
checked
every
door
and
cupboard
in
the
superstructure
.
It
was
only
when
they
came
out
of
the
rearmost
door
and
found
a
temporary
hut
facing
them
with
Radio
Room
marked
on
the
door
,
that
they
realised
why
they
had
n't
found
it
the
first
time
.
At
a
nod
from
Delaney
,
Forster
gently
turned
the
handle
.
Then
Delaney
rushed
forward
,
shoulder
first
,
bursting
the
door
open
as
he
rolled
in
,
with
Forster
's
light
beam
sweeping
way
ahead
of
him
.
The
room
was
empty
.
They
stared
around
them
in
disbelief
.
Although
Grant
was
the
expert
of
the
group
,
they
both
knew
enough
to
realise
that
the
equipment
stacked
around
was
sophisticated
,
and
far
too
much
for
Titron
if
she
had
been
but
an
ordinary
container
ship
.
And
by
now
they
knew
she
was
not
.
A
red
light
above
the
panel
showed
the
equipment
was
on
,
supplied
by
automatic
power
,
probably
from
batteries
.
Forster
moved
further
into
the
room
.
"
Looks
more
like
the
communications
centre
of
a
nuclear
sub
.
"
They
searched
carefully
until
they
were
satisfied
that
the
sensitive
area
was
not
armed
for
self-destruction
,
as
many
were
.
Delaney
finally
thumbed
the
button
on
the
speaker
set
.
The
static
roared
out
from
the
earphones
,
stronger
than
ever
.
He
held
the
headset
away
from
him
,
using
only
one
ear
as
they
tried
several
wavelengths
.
It
was
hopeless
.
Delaney
gave
up
,
shutting
it
off
and
swivelling
out
of
the
chair
.
"
Something

Forster
held
up
his
transceiver
.
"
We
could
try
tracking
it

"
They
went
outside
,
Forster
turning
around
with
the
set
switched
on
,
and
finding
the
direction
where
the
static
was
the
strongest
.
"
It
's
coming
from

stern

They
worked
their
way
past
the
starboard
lifeboat
,
and
down
another
short
ladder
.
Against
the
lighter
foaming
sea
was
just
visible
a
large
windowless
domed
structure
.
They
paused
,
weighing
it
up
.
"

Forster
questioned
.
"
Or
some
sort

Delaney
nodded
.
"
It

me

"
As
they
drew
nearer
they
became
conscious
of
a
high
pitched
humming
noise
.
Forster
tried
the
transceiver
.
The
interference
was
total
.
They
walked
around
the
outside
.
There
was
no
visible
way
in
.
Forster
scratched
at
a
riveted
panel
without
success
.
"

reached

deck
level

Delaney
nodded
,
sinking
to
his
haunches
.
From
one
of
his
pouches
he
took
what
looked
like
a
package
of
grey
plasticine
.
Removing
the
wrapping
he
began
pressing
the
plastic
explosive
tightly
around
the
rivet
line
.
Forster
grinned
.
"

it
up

Delaney
did
n't
look
up
,
but
carried
on
with
his
preparations
.
"

at
the
MOD
have
n't
played
fair
with
us
,
so
I
owe
them
nothing
.
"
Forster
chuckled
.
"
You
're
probably
going
to
set
the
taxpayer
back
a
couple
of
million
,
unless
these
things
are
made
of
plate
steel
.
"
Delaney
inserted
the
detonator
pin
attached
to
the
timer
,
primed
the
circuit
,
and
set
ten
seconds
of
fuse
.
Legging
it
,
they
got
down
behind
cover
just
as
the
last
second
ran
out
.
The
night
was
split
by
an
orange
flash
that
lit
the
stem
of
the
ship
.
It
was
followed
by
a
hammer
blow
that
echoed
like
thunder
through
the
steel
hulk
.
Dense
,
acrid
smoke
swirled
unseen
in
the
night
wind
,
a
choking
mixture
of
burning
chemical
and
insulation
material
that
forced
them
to
re-don
their
respirators
.
They
moved
back
nearer
,
getting
to
windward
.
The
domed
structure
was
wrecked
,
smashed
open
at
one
side
like
an
eggshell
.
Inside
,
the
blaze
was
already
fierce
,
fanned
by
the
high
wind
,
the
heat
building
up
so
that
they
could
see
the
metal
beginning
to
glow
.
Forster
's
grotesque
rubber
mask
nodded
at
the
inferno
.
"
Aluminium
.
"
Delaney
agreed
.
"
Now
let's
give
this
a
try
.
"
He
pulled
off
his
mask
and
used
his
transceiver
to
call
the
bridge
.
Nell
answered
loud
and
clear
.
"
What
the
hell
is
happening
back
there
?
"
"
We
're
having
a
firework
party
,
"
Delaney
drawled
,
"
with
a
bit
of
suspicious
equipment
.
No
contact
-
human
or
otherwise
.
"
His
attempt
at
a
joke
misfired
.
"
We
're
going
back
to
the
wireless
room
.
See
if
you
can
raise
Silk
on
his
radio
.
He
may
still
be
alive
.
"
It
seemed
foolish
,
such
a
suggestion
.
There
had
been
so
much
blood
,
but
-
Forster
pointed
at
the
fire
.
"
What
about
that
?
"
"
Nothing
we
can
do
but
check
it
now
and
then
,
"
Delaney
said
,
shrugging
.
"
If
the
worst
happens
and
it
spreads
I
reckon
help
should
have
arrived
before
it
gets
serious
.
"
They
turned
back
into
the
swirling
smoke
,
and
up
the
ladder
to
the
superstructure
,
regaining
the
door
to
the
wireless
hut
.
Delaney
went
in
,
and
pulled
up
as
if
he
had
been
hit
with
a
magnum
at
close
range
.
Facing
him
was
a
man
-
white
,
shaking
and
terrified
.
Forster
crouched
in
.
"
Jesus
!
"
The
man
screamed
,
leapt
back
,
smashing
over
a
chair
.
It
was
then
that
they
saw
the
grenade
in
his
hand
.
Gradually
,
Delaney
opened
his
arms
,
finally
holding
his
Uzi
wide
from
his
body
.
"
Easy
,
"
he
said
quietly
,
"
we
're
here
to
help
you
.
"
Forster
straightened
up
slowly
,
moving
gently
aside
so
that
they
were
not
a
grouped
target
.
Whimpering
,
the
man
cringed
,
hands
shaking
as
he
raised
the
grenade
in
front
of
him
,
one
hand
on
the
pin
.
Delaney
's
eyes
never
left
those
of
the
man
as
cautiously
he
tried
again
.
"
We
're
friends
.
Sent
from
London
.
There
's
nothing
to
worry
about
.
Whatever
happened
here
is
over
now
.
We
can
take
you
away
.
"
Forster
,
still
inching
aside
,
murmured
sympathetically
.
"
What
's
been
going
on
?
Pretty
rough
,
was
it
?
"
The
man
was
sweating
profusely
,
and
suddenly
a
dark
stain
spread
on
the
front
of
his
trousers
.
Delaney
and
Forster
exchanged
quick
,
worried
glances
,
for
the
man
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
total
derangement
.
Delaney
realised
that
their
respirators
were
dehumanising
and
frightening
,
thus
preventing
his
facial
expressions
from
communicating
confidence
.
He
began
to
move
his
hand
towards
his
mask
.
"
We
're
men
from
the
Navy
.
You
'll
be
all
right
now
.
I
'm
going
to
take
my
respirator
off
.
You
'll
see
.
"
As
his
hand
closed
on
the
rubber
border
,
the
man
appeared
to
steady
,
staring
fixedly
as
if
fascinated
by
the
spectacle
.
Delaney
did
nothing
suddenly
.
He
pulled
the
mask
forward
slowly
,
relying
for
his
protection
on
Forster
while
he
was
temporarily
blinded
.
Hair
ruffled
,
his
face
came
clear
.
Delaney
smiled
encouragingly
.
"
There
-
"
The
man
screamed
,
yanked
out
the
pin
and
threw
the
grenade
.
The
brown
egg
struck
the
wall
behind
Delaney
's
head
with
a
clang
and
whirled
back
to
bounce
on
the
top
of
the
radio
bench
.
As
Delaney
and
Forster
hit
the
deck
they
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
crazed
man
going
for
it
again
.
Still
rolling
,
Forster
shot
from
the
hip
.
Instantly
,
the
reaching
figure
became
a
puppet
,
jerking
backwards
in
a
pirouette
that
suddenly
collapsed
with
the
abrupt
finality
of
cut
strings
.
The
brown
egg
spun
on
its
own
axis
,
became
a
bead
of
intense
brilliant
yellow
that
immediately
filled
the
room
.
The
explosion
blew
out
the
windows
and
door
,
and
shattered
the
banks
of
units
,
sucking
up
a
whirling
storm
of
glass
and
wires
that
whiplashed
their
arm-covered
heads
.
It
took
seconds
for
the
last
bit
to
drop
.
The
silence
was
deafening
.
They
got
cautiously
to
their
feet
,
surveying
the
wreckage
and
carnage
.
Delaney
looked
bitterly
at
the
shambles
.
"
It
's
ripped
the
guts
out
of
the
radio
.
"
"
And
him
,
"
Forster
nodded
,
looking
down
at
the
shattered
,
eviscerated
remains
of
the
man
.
Nell
Anderson
,
Grant
and
Lawton
listened
while
events
were
recounted
.
Delaney
appealed
to
her
.
"
Honestly
,
Nell
,
we
did
nothing
sudden
.
It
was
as
if
he
was
utterly
mad
.
Frightened
beyond
any
recall
.
"
Forster
nodded
.
"
Maybe
we
should
have
jumped
him
,
then
perhaps
you
could
have
injected
him
with
something
.
"
She
shrugged
non-commitally
.
"
What
could
do
that
,
"
Delaney
wanted
to
know
,
"
to
drive
a
man
so
insane
?
"
His
voice
trailed
off
helplessly
.
Nell
looked
thoughtful
.
"
Before
we
came
aboard
this
ship
I
was
thinking
of
the
possibilities
.
"
Delaney
eyed
her
speculatively
.
"
Ergot
poisoning
.
It
would
explain
why
the
crew
were
not
present
-
had
possibly
jumped
overboard
as
mental
disintegration
deepened
.
"
"
You
're
saying
that
this
crazed
man
fitted
the
picture
?
"
"
He
would
,
indeed
,
"
Nell
confirmed
.
"
It
is
one
of
the
reasons
advanced
for
the
solution
to
the
Marie
Celeste
mystery
,
that
the
flour
might
have
been
contaminated
with
ergot
.
It
produces
weird
hallucinations
.
Several
so-called
religious
visions
of
the
Middle
Ages
have
since
been
attributed
to
it
.
"
Her
face
became
troubled
.
"
Only
-
"
Delaney
grimaced
.
"
Only
what
,
Nell
?
"
She
shook
her
head
slowly
,
just
the
once
.
"
It
does
n't
explain
our
mysterious
man
in
the
hold
.
"
There
was
a
depressing
silence
.
"

hallucination

n't
kill

did
it

Theo
saw
an
exceptionally
tall
figure
.
And
we
have
n't
drunk
or
eaten
anything
from
on
board
.
"
Lawton
shuffled
uneasily
,
but
did
n't
try
and
contradict
her
or
go
back
on
his
description
.
"
The
gas
?
"
asked
Grant
.
Nell
shook
her
head
.
"
Nobody
else
experience
any
ill-effects
.
"
"
What
she
did
n't
say
and
was
too
embarrassed
to
talk
about
was
an
uncanny
feeling
that
she
had
only
recently
become
aware
of
,
but
now
realised
had
been
growing
in
her
ever
since
she
had
set
foot
on
Titron
.
It
was
as
if
a
crumbling
away
of
the
carefully
built-up
layers
of
education
,
technical
training
,
so-called
civilisation
,
was
taking
place
,
leaving
her
stripped
of
all
her
carefully
acquired
adult
assurance
.
Deep
inside
her
had
been
awakened
a
nameless
,
primitive
fear
that
at
first
had
ached
away
in
the
background
,
but
slowly
had
grown
more
evident
,
more
pronounced
,
like
a
stared-at
,
half-perceived
figure
in
the
shadowy
corner
of
a
bedroom
.
The
same
feeling
when
,
as
a
girl
,
she
had
woken
from
a
nightmare
,
and
sat
in
the
dark
,
not
sure
if
she
was
really
awake
;
really
alone
.
Titron
she
knew
,
with
female
,
celtic
instinct
,
was
truly
evil
.
And
the
nightmare
was
only
just
beginning
.
Dawn
came
slowly
,
uncertainly
,
with
first
,
the
white
foam
on
the
huge
breaking
waves
becoming
more
noticeable
.
It
was
a
false
dawn
,
replaced
soon
after
by
a
now
starless
night
that
was
blacker
than
the
previous
hours
.
True
dawn
came
as
a
dirty
yellow
streak
in
the
east
that
slowly
lost
its
colour
as
it
spread
into
a
cold
grey
,
filled
with
racing
clouds
.
Delaney
had
taken
the
first
watch
with
Forster
.
He
reviewed
the
situation
as
he
gazed
unseeingly
out
of
the
rain-lashed
windows
,
at
the
huge
bows
of
Titron
,
as
she
wallowed
helplessly
in
the
heaving
seas
.
He
had
suffered
casualties
-
one
man
missing
,
presumed
dead
,
another
partially
disabled
.
Below
decks
lurked
something
that
at
the
moment
defied
the
imagination
.
The
only
crew
member
they
had
located
had
been
totally
insane
-
with
fear
.
Delaney
had
been
told
to
hold
Titron
for
forty-eight
hours
.
That
he
reckoned
he
could
still
do
.
The
casualty
rate
so
far
was
no
more
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
hazardous
nature
of
the
operation
,
and
although
he
could
not
,
in
all
honesty
,
say
he
was
in
command
of
the
whole
ship
,
he
at
least
held
the
strategic
upper
hand
.
Whoever
,
or
whatever
was
in
the
hold
seemed
unwilling
or
unable
-
they
had
battened
down
the
hatch
once
more
-
to
do
battle
in
the
open
.
As
yet
.
But
what
really
was
to
happen
after
the
forty-eight
hours
?
He
had
uneasily
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
Connors
had
been
more
than
vague
,
had
actually
held
back
vital
information
.
Or
did
n't
he
or
anybody
back
in
Whitehall
know
the
full
truth
?
There
was
something
very
odd
-
disturbing
-
about
Titron
,
a
ship
that
wandered
the
world
's
seas
,
never
making
landfall
,
carrying
its
dark
secret
forever
in
its
belly
.
Delaney
frowned
.
Now
why
had
he
thought
-
forever
?
When
he
awoke
,
Delaney
found
Nell
on
watch
outside
the
wheelhouse
,
hair
blowing
wildly
in
the
sea-filled
wind
,
binoculars
searching
the
storm-tossed
horizon
.
He
stood
beside
her
,
clutching
the
rail
.
"
You
OK
?
"
he
asked
.
Nell
tried
to
smile
.
"
Better
for
some
fresh
air
.
"
They
stood
in
silence
as
she
quartered
the
horizon
again
.
"
Anything
?
"
he
asked
.
She
lowered
the
binoculars
.
"
I
keep
seeing
a
periscope
-
"
she
semi-joked
.
Delaney
was
suddenly
alert
.
"
Where
?
"
he
said
,
urgently
.
Nell
shook
her
head
ruefully
.
"
Forget
it
.
It
's
me
-
really
.
"
Delaney
was
unconvinced
as
he
held
out
his
hand
.
"
Let
me
make
sure
.
"
Nell
unslung
the
binoculars
and
handed
them
to
him
.
"
Probably
a
shark
.
I
'm
not
at
my
best
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
"
"
First
thing
?
"
He
grunted
as
he
took
the
binoculars
.
"
It
's
ten
o'clock
.
Now
,
where
do
I
look
?
"
Nell
pointed
.
Delaney
focussed
in
on
the
waves
piling
up
tightly
one
behind
the
other
,
like
a
huge
wall
in
the
foreshortened
view
.
He
spent
several
minutes
observing
,
but
saw
nothing
.
He
handed
the
binoculars
back
to
Nell
.
"
Satisfied
?
"
Delaney
gave
a
weary
smile
.

took

Caught
out
by

At
first
,
angry
with
herself
for
over-reacting
,
Nell
felt
suddenly
deflated
.
She
had
n't
planned
to
approach
him
like
this
.
It
had
just
happened
.
It
was
out
in
the
open
now
,
her
thoughts
of
that
last
hour
as
she
had
kept
her
lonely
vigil
.
"

she
said
calmly
,
"
to

out
as
much
as
we
can

"
He
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
with
real
unease
.
Delaney
knew
what
she
was
implying
.
"
You
've
signed
the
official
secrets
act

he
reminded
her
gruffly
.

it

They
'd
hush
you
up
-
somehow
.
"
In
emphasising
the
last
word
he
wanted
her
to
realise
that
he
was
as
cynical
about
the
ultimate
behaviour
of
any
Government
Department
,
of
any
shade
of
political
persuasion
,
as
she
was
.
Probably
more
so
.
Nell
continued
to
stare
at
the
sea
for
a
very
long
time
.
Delaney
watched
her
-
watched
the
reddish
hair
playing
around
her
cheek
,
and
the
lips
that
he
suddenly
wanted
to
cover
with
his
own
.
The
urge
grew
and
grew
,
gathering
strength
from
its
own
realisation
.
Delaney
took
her
shoulders
,
and
turned
her
towards
him
.
She
thought
he
was
going
to
say
something
to
put
her
straight
.
"
I
refuse
to
-
"
she
began
defiantly
.
He
closed
his
mouth
down
around
hers
,
and
for
a
moment
she
was
too
stunned
to
react
.
Then
a
natural
aggression
kicked
in
.
Nell
's
hands
came
up
,
and
began
to
push
him
away
.
It
was
only
when
she
realised
that
she
had
n't
used
the
unarmed
combat
that
was
by
now
second
nature
to
her
,
but
was
struggling
in
a
manner
that
was
instinctive
,
that
she
stopped
.
Perplexed
,
she
closed
her
eyes
,
then
opened
them
again
to
reassure
herself
she
was
n't
dreaming
.
Finally
,
she
closed
them
once
more
.
When
they
parted
they
looked
searchingly
at
each
other
.
She
rested
her
head
on
his
chest
.
"
What
made
you
do
that
?
"
Delaney
hesitated
,
then
stroked
her
wildly-blowing
hair
,
feeling
it
fluttering
in
his
hand
,
like
a
captured
bird
.
"
It
just
came
over
me
.
I

a
suspicion

for
some
time

"
He
felt
her
head
give
the
merest
of
nods
.
Her
small-voiced
reply
was
all
but
lost
in
the
wind
.
"
I
'm
glad
you
did

"
Delaney
straightened
,
took
her
chin
and
gently
turned
her
face
back
up
to
his
.
The
kiss
was
the
slightest
brush
of
the
lips
,
but
in
its
easy
acceptance
sent
a
spasm
of
aggressive
pleasure
coursing
through
him
.
"
Come
on

he
said
briskly
.
"
Back

"
Lawton
and
Forster
brought
good
news

Both
men
were
soaking
as
Lawton
make
his
report
,
the
drops
trickling
down
their
wet
suits
.
"

as
if
to
underline
his
words
a
creaming
beam
wave
appeared
in
the
middle
distance
,
suddenly
becoming
apparent
that
it
was
a
freak
.

Lawton
did
n't
cross
himself
,
Catholic
or
not
,
but
joined
the
rest
in
finding
a
place
to
support
himself
as
the
wall
of
water
roared
silently
down
on
them
.
It
reached
Titron
.
The
solid
wall
of
water
exploded
against
the
side
of
the
ship
,
falling
inboard
in
a
white
avalanche
as
Titron
heeled
over
.
Grant
's
grip
was
broken
.
He
spun
across
the
deck
and
hit
the
far
wall
..
Before
Titron
was
fully
upright
a
second
giant
wave
fell
upon
her
.
It
roared
over
the
deck
,
detonating
against
the
stacked
containers
,
bursting
upwards
in
geysers
that
reached
hungrily
at
the
armoured
plate
glass
of
the
bridge
.
Titron
went
over
to
an
angle
of
thirty-five
degrees
.
Forster
stared
through
the
near
side
window
at
the
raging
sea
.
"

he
yelled
,
"

With
a
scream

sheering
steel
several
containers
slewed
to
one
side
,
smashing
into
each
other

Lawton
struggled
over
to
Delaney
,
running
with
short
quick
steps
,
as
the
deck
came
up
again
.

nodded
.
"

made
to
join
them
.

Savagely

Forster

the
telegraph
repeater
rang

the
pointers
moved
and
came
back
to

Almost
immediately
they
felt
the
vibration
in
the
deck
,
a
steady
throbbing
that
was
there
as
a
constant
background
between
the
ringing
blows
of
the
storm

Delaney
was
the
first

react

Nothing
came
back
.
He
tried
several
times
without
success
.
Despite
their
action
with
the
wheel
thousands
more
tons
of
ocean
fell
on
to
Titron
.
"
Try

Delaney
shouted
in
desperation
.
Forster
scrambled
along
to
the
telegraph
and
rang
the
order
.
Outside
,
another
fierce
white
explosion
of
water
burst
over
the
side
,
carried
by
the
screaming
banshee
of
a
wind
on
to
the
armoured
glass
plate
of
the
bridge
.
Grimly
they
hung
on
,
staring
at
the
graduated
circle
of
the
instrument
,
and
the
indicator
that
still
rested
at
"

Forster
's
open
mouth
arrested
in
mid-sentence
as
the
repeater
bell
rang
out
and
the
indicators
moved
to
"
half
ahead
together
"
.
All
three
struggled
with
the
wheel
.
Titron
was
slow
to
respond
,
then
seemed
to
gather
strength
,
the
bows
turning
into
the
storm
.
The
violent
,
erratic
rolling
slowly
changed
into
a
regular
rising
and
falling
.
Staring
through
the
streaming
window
,
Nell
gritted
her
teeth
every
time
the
bows
pushed
out
over
the
top
of
a
big
wave
,
only
to
hang
in
space
before
dropping
away
into
the
sixty-odd
feet
of
the
following
trough
that
seemed
to
her
a
mile
deep
.
She
felt
,
rather
than
heard
herself
moan
,
as
they
went
down
.
When
the
bows
plunged
into
the
slate
black
water
at
the
bottom
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
would
go
on
diving
in
,
engulfed
by
the
on-rushing
sea
,
never
to
return
to
the
surface
.
Invariably
Titron
came
up
,
green
water
avalanching
into
white
that
flared
back
in
the
wind
.
They
began
to
relax
,
Delaney
and
Forster
leaving
the
wheel
to
Lawton
.
Forster
took
up
a
position
with
his
back
to
the
bows
,
wedging
himself
into
a
corner
as
Delaney
tried
the
ship
's
telephone
again
,
speaking
slowly
and
deliberately
.
"
Whoever

It
took
them
unaware
,
chilling
their
blood
.
The
reply
,
a
weird
breathing
sound
,
and
an
unintelligible
,
totally
alien
jabbering
.
Then
it
cut
off
as
suddenly
as
it
had
started
.
The
silence
in
the
wheelhouse
was
,
if
anything
,
emphasised
by
the
storm
outside
.
"
Well

Forster
drawled
,
"

's
a
hand
of
some
sort
down
there

"

Nell
Anderson
said
it
,
knowing
that
it
was
hopeless
,
that
Delaney
would
-
had
to
go
down
to
the
engine
room
.
Nothing
would
stop
him
,
yet
she
struggled
now
to
contain
the
fear
that
was
in
her
,
spreading
like
some
pernicious
cancer
.
Conscious
of
her
troubled
state
of
mind
,
Delaney
gave
her
a
quick
,
comforting
smile
,
embarrassed
that
the
others
might
instantly
pick
up
any
nuance
of
their
changed
relationship
.
"
Two

Delaney
looked
across
at

who
straightened
himself
up
.
"

it
.
"
As
soon
as
Delaney
slid
open
the
wheelhouse
door
the
roaring
hurricane
reached
in
,
plucking
at
anything
loose
,
snapping
the
curtain
that
sectioned
off
the
chart
room
,
jingling
a
row
of
metal-clipped
notices
.
Hands
white
with
cold
,
they
struggled
along
the
gangway
and
down
the
stairs
.
As
they
reached
the
level
of
the
deck
a
wall
of
green
water
lifted
with
a
monstrous
boom
at
the
bow
then
broke
into
huge
white
columns
of
water
,
not
unlike
a
Niagara
Fall
that
carried
majestically
the
length
of
Titron
.
Delaney
and
Forster
were
engulfed
in
a
hammering
storm
of
water
that
forced
them
almost
to
their
knees
.
They
hung
on
until
the
battering
ceased
,
then
ran
,
slithering
in
the
sluicing
torrent
of
water
until
they
reached
the
hatch
that
led
below
decks
.
Delaney
nodded
,
Forster
snapped
down
the
securing
lever
and
pulled
.
Delaney
jumped
in
,
Forster
right
behind
him
,
the
steel
door
slamming
shut
with
a
clang
.
After
the
wildness
outside
,
their
ears
were
momentarily
stunned
,
the
silence
seeming
absolute
.
Then
slowly
they
heard
it
-
the
distant
rumble
of
the
30,000
hp
diesels
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
ship
.
Periodically
the
rumble
accelerated
as
the
propellers
came
clear
of
the
water
,
throbbing
like
a
heart
beat
.
And
suddenly
,
the
great
steel
hulk
was
no
longer
a
hulk
.
Titron
was
alive
.
Delaney
reached
in
his
pack
and
pulled
out
his
respirator
.
"
We
'll
wear
these
,
"
he
said
.
"
Just
in
case
.
"
They
moved
cautiously
along
a
dimly-lit
passage
until
they
reached
the
steep
narrow
ladder
that
descended
to
the
next
level
.
The
first
man
walking
down
would
be
totally
exposed
-
helpless
.
Delaney
dropped
to
his
belly
and
snake-like
began
to
descend
,
head
first
,
down
the
ladder
.
Forster
held
his
legs
,
leaving
Delaney
free
to
grip
his
Smith
and
Wesson
two-handed
,
searching
through
the
metal
steps
for
any
danger
.
There
was
none
.
He
slid
to
the
bottom
,
Forster
following
.
They
repeated
the
move
at
each
level
,
the
pulsating
roar
getting
louder
and
louder
.
Finally
,
Delaney
's
masked
black
figure
slid
down
into
an
area
that
was
wider
and
better
lit
.
It
ran
the
width
of
the
ship
and
was
full
of
machinery
.
He
dived
behind
a
storage
tank
,
covering
as
Forster
dropped
lightly
to
his
feet
and
ducked
down
beside
a
bench
.
The
noise
was
like
a
factory
.
They
carefully
scanned
the
area
,
unmoving
,
and
waiting
for
any
sign
of
life
.
Delaney
saw
Forster
nod
,
the
light
flashing
on
his
eye-pieces
.
It
was
a
steel
,
water-tight
door
.
Delaney
understood
.
He
signalled
his
understanding
.
Through
it
was
the
main
engine
room
.
As
they
began
to
move
towards
it
they
noticed
that
the
door
was
bigger
than
the
others
and
could
quite
easily
accommodate
two
men
abreast
.
Crouched
down
beside
it
,
Delaney
took
another
searching
glance
behind
him
,
at
the
lifeless
,
cluttered
room
.
Nothing
moved
.
Delaney
steadied
himself
,
holstering
the
Smith
and
Wesson
and
unslinging
the
Uzi
.
He
nodded
to
his
companion
.
Forster
smashed
down
the
locking
lever
,
and
pulled
for
all
his
worth
.
Delaney
lurched
forward
,
unable
to
stop
himself
shouldering
the
door
hard
.
It
had
n't
moved
.
Quickly
,
Forster
worked
the
bar
again
,
and
again
.
But
the
door
remained
firmly
shut
.
Forster
thumbed
his
radio
.
"
The
mechanism
's
jammed
.
"
Delaney
straightened
up
and
searched
around
.
He
found
a
heavy
wrench
and
hammered
on
the
door
.
There
was
no
discernible
response
.
He
hammered
again
,
pulling
off
his
mask
,
and
shouting
.
"
Open
up
!
We
're
here
to
help
.
"
The
pulsating
roar
of
the
engines
formed
a
steady
background
as
Delaney
kept
up
a
barrage
on
the
door
.
Finally
,
following
suit
,
Forster
took
off
his
mask
.
He
frowned
.
"
What
's
that
funny
smell
?
"
Puzzled
,
Delaney
looked
at
him
.
"
What
are
you
talking
about
?
"
"
Ca
n't
you
detect
it
?
A
sort
of
dry
,
musty
o
dour
.
"
Irritated
,
Delaney
brushed
Forster
aside
.
"
Come
on
,
"
he
said
briskly
.
"
We
'll
-
"
He
caught
sight
of
the
small
perspex
circle
,
bulging
like
a
half-an-inch
magnifying
glass
,
set
in
the
steel
to
one
side
.
It
was
a
tiny
observation
port
designed
to
give
a
view
in
an
emergency
of
level
of
water
or
degree
of
fire
in
the
engine
room
beyond
.
He
peered
through
.
There
was
a
whiteness
,
with
thousands
of
tiny
red
lines
meandering
outwards
like
fine
tributaries
of
a
river
.
It
reminded
him
of
a
veined
glass
marble
he
had
once
owned
as
a
boy
.
And
in
the
middle
was
yet
another
marble
-
dark
,
gleaming
,
and
full
of
mysterious
moving
depths
.
He
stared
at
it
,
puzzled
,
deciding
it
was
pulsating
,
with
red
lines
swelling
and
diminishing
in
the
self-same
rhythm
;
tentacles
that
throbbed
with
the
heart
beat
of
the
central
creature
.
The
shiny
black
central
sphere
flicked
suddenly
to
one
side
,
jumped
as
if
touched
,
like
an
animalcule
at
the
bottom
of
a
microscope
imprisoned
by
the
tension
of
a
viscous
fluid
.
And
in
that
moment
he
saw
the
shape
formed
by
the
moving
depths
.
It
was
the
reflection
of
his
own
face
.
He
knew
what
he
was
looking
at
.
It
was
an
eye
.
Delaney
was
transfixed
,
staring
back
like
a
rabbit
before
a
snake
.
The
pupil
jerked
again
,
seemed
to
grow
bigger
,
becoming
a
black
empty
void
,
an
unfathomable
waste
of
madness
,
a
madness
that
seemed
to
reach
out
and
engulf
him
.
He
began
to
sweat
,
a
weird
cold
extrusion
of
moisture
that
began
to
trickle
down
his
face
.
And
he
knew
without
doubt
that
the
door
must
not
be
opened
;
that
it
was
a
door
of
a
Pandora
's
Box
.
"
What
can
you
see
?
"
Forster
impatient
,
broke
the
spell
.
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
Delaney
croaked
.
"
It
's
the
eye
of
something
.
"
He
broke
free
then
said
hoarsely
,
"
Look
for
yourself
.
"
Forster
took
his
place
.
"
There
's
nothing
there
.
"
He
turned
back
to
find
Delaney
slumped
against
the
wall
.
His
face
was
green
-
and
wet
.
"
Here
.
You
all
right
?
"
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
Feel
a
bit
groggy
.
"
Immediately
,
Forster
shouldered
his
Uzi
,
and
took
Delaney
's
arm
over
his
shoulder
.
"
Come
on
.
Let's
get
you
topside
.
We
're
doing
no
good
here
.
"
As
Forster
helped
Delaney
to
the
ladder
he
was
unaware
of
the
huge
distorted
eye
watching
him
.
The
journey
back
to
the
surface
was
a
nightmare
.
Delaney
became
weaker
and
vomited
.
They
finally
reached
the
deck
.
Forster
struggled
with
the
door
in
the
wind
.
As
soon
as
Delaney
stumbled
through
he
was
sent
reeling
by
a
wave
,
clutching
at
a
pillar
for
support
,
and
nearly
going
over
the
side
.
The
storm
was
raging
unabated
.
Forster
slithered
to
Delaney
and
got
a
grip
,
pulling
him
back
to
comparative
safety
.
Nell
finished
taking
his
pulse
.
"
It
's
a
hundred
and
fifteen
now
.
"
She
took
the
thermometer
from
his
mouth
,
and
when
she
continued
to
stare
at
it
he
was
Unable
to
keep
the
note
of
anxiety
out
of
his
voice
.
"
Well
?
"
She
shook
the
thermometer
vigorously
,
then
wiped
the
end
with
antiseptic
.
"
Gene
-
your
turn
.
"
Forster
began
to
protest
,
but
she
pushed
the
thermometer
unceremoniously
into
his
mouth
.
Delaney
persisted
.
"
You
did
n't
answer
me
,
Nell
.
"
She
commenced
wrapping
a
blood
pressure
cuff
around
his
arm
.
"
It
was
below
normal
-
unusually
below
.
"
Delaney
frowned
.
"
But
I
was
sweating
.
"
Nell
pumped
up
the
air
,
constricting
the
blood
supply
,
then
bled
it
out
again
,
listening
with
her
stethoscope
for
the
returning
pulse
.
She
did
it
twice
,
then
pulled
the
instrument
from
her
ears
and
began
to
unwrap
the
rubber
.
"
That
might
explain
it
.
Low
and
thready
pulse
,
low
blood
pressure
-
a
condition
analogous
to
a
faint
,
peripheral
blood
supply
dilated
.
Hence
a
cold
sweat
.
"
She
paused
and
frowned
.
"
But
I
do
n't
understand
the
abnormally
low
temperature
.
"
She
plucked
the
thermometer
from
Forster
and
held
it
unbelievingly
in
front
of
her
.
Forster
's
face
twitched
.
"
Bad
news
?
"
he
asked
anxiously
.
Nell
snapped
back
into
action
,
shaking
the
thermometer
.
"
Down
a
bit
.
You
were
obviously
less
affected
.
"
Forster
looked
worried
.
"
Affected
?
By
what
?
"
She
cleaned
and
replaced
the
thermometer
into
its
flap
in
the
field
dressing
case
.
"
I
do
n't
know
.
"
"
I
only
felt
a
bit
off
,

Forster
admitted
.
"
Put
it
down
to
the
movement
of
the
ship

can
all
get
seasick

after
years
of
boats
.
"
"
I

She
frowned
then
directed
her
question
at
Delaney
.
"
You
say
you
only
began
to
feel
funny
while
you
were
looking
at
the
eye

"
"
Yes
.
"
Delaney
was
emphatic
.
That
alone
made
him
feel
foolish
.
Was
he
becoming
mentally
ill
?
If
so
,
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
for
the
moment
.
After
this
was
over
he
would
get
a
full
medical
check
.
In
fact
he
would
have
to
.
Nell
would
be
duty-bound
to
report
.
And
then
he
remembered
something
.
Nell
,
too
,
had
said
she
was
feeling
depressed
and
peculiar
.
Was
Titron
weaving
its
spell
?
But
how
?
Was
this
the
way
it
had
begun
for
the
crew
?
Delaney
knew
that
he
had
to
talk
more
with
Nell
,
and
warn
the
others
.
But
suddenly
he
felt
utterly
exhausted
.
"
Got
to
rest
.
Theo
,
will
you
take
over
?
"
"
Sure
.
"
Nell
helped
him
to
lie
down
on
a
blanket
,
supporting
his
head
with
another
.
Worried
,
she
fussed
around
him
,
so
much
so
that
he
gripped
her
hand
.
"
I
'm
OK
,
really
.
Just
need
to
sleep
it
off
.
"
With
that
he
blacked
out
.
When
he
came
to
,
he
was
disorientated
,
staring
blankly
at
a
man
sitting
with
his
back
to
him
.
Then
the
confusion
lifted
,
and
he
remembered
.
It
was
Grant
,
at
a
control
console
.
Nell
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
,
keeping
a
look
out
.
Delaney
felt
his
head
.
It
was
aching
badly
,
but
the
heaviness
had
gone
completely
.
He
groaned
.
Nell
turned
,
and
came
over
to
him
quickly
.
She
sank
down
beside
him
,
hand
moving
to
his
forehead
.
"
How
do
you
feel

Delaney
sagged
against
the
wall
.
"
Better

Relieved
,
her
hand
ruffled
his
hair

some
people

Her
easy
warmth
made
Delaney
feel
good
,
as
he
licked
his
dry
lips
.
"

straightened

up

Nell
moved

of
cans
and
packets
on
the
floor
near
him
,
kneeling
as
she
ignited
a
solid
fuel
heater
.
"
They
've
gone
on
a
recce
.
"
"
Why
?
"
he
asked
,
suddenly
alert
.
Nell
continued
watching
the
flaring
heat
.
"
We
've
had
a
breakthrough
.
"
She
placed
a
tea
bag
into
a
mug
as
Grant
answered
.
"
With
the
power
on
I
began
investigating
some
of
these
control
panels
.
The
ones
I
did
n't
recognise
.
Came
up
with
this
.
"
He
stood
up
and
moved
aside
,
revealing
a
bank
of
small
closed
circuit
television
monitoring
screens
.
Delaney
staggered
over
,
half
falling
into
the
vacated
chair
.
Most
of
the
distorted
blue-green
views
showed
a
series
of
rectangular
corridors
,
many
with
louvred
side
doors
that
Delaney
did
not
recognise
.
They
were
not
like
the
crew
quarters
,
but
reminded
him
more
of
a
hospital
,
even
before
he
saw
what
appeared
to
be
an
operating
theatre
.
Another
showed
a
row
of
cell-like
steel
doors
.
Delaney
peered
closer
at
the
last
one
,
the
view
spoilt
by
the
fast
upward
flickering
of
the
frame
.
Grant
obligingly
twiddled
a
knob
,
but
to
no
avail
.
"
I
'm
afraid
the
hold
has
gone
on
that
one
.
"
Nell
came
over
,
and
waved
at
the
whole
lot
.
"
We
reckon
it
's
the
missing
laboratory
.
"
"
But
where
the
hell
is
it
situated
?
"
Grant
pointed
at
one
of
the
screens
.
"
You
can
just
make
out
the
division
markings
on
the
walls
where
they
've
joined
the
units
.
"
It
sank
in
.
Delaney
looked
closer
for
confirmation
.
"
It
's
the
inside
of
the
containers
in
the
hold
.
They
've
been
used
like
sectional
housing
.
A
sort
of
prefabricated
complex
.
"
Grant
nodded
his
agreement
.
But
somebody
's
gone
to
considerable
lengths
to
disguise
the
fact
.
"
The
water
began
to
boil
.
"
Something
significant
about
all
this
equipment
?
"
Nell
asked
as
she
turned
away
.
She
did
n't
wait
for
a
reply
,
but
spelled
out
the
answer
herself
.
"
To
have
a
surveillance
system
on
a
ship
where
everybody
is
involved
can
only
mean
one
thing
.
"
"
Which
is
?
"
Delaney
prompted
.
"
It
's
a
system
not
to
guard
against
intruders
,
but
a
system
to
ensure
that
somebody
does
n't
get
out
.
And
somebody
,
if
you
ask
me
,
who
is
bloody
dangerous
.
"
The
uncharacteristic
profanity
brought
him
around
in
the
chair
.
"
How
long
have
they
been
gone
?
"
Nell
finished
pouring
the
boiling
water
into
a
mug
as
Grant
checked
his
watch
.
"
About
half
an
hour
.
They
went
to
find
the
entrance
to
the
complex
.
Reckoned
it
was
in
the
superstructure
below
somewhere
.
"
Delaney
gratefully
accepted
the
mug
of
tea
from
Nell
.
"
Why
did
n't
they
wait
for
me
?
"
Grant
glanced
at
Nell
.
"
We
had
no
idea
how
long
you
'd
be
out
,
"
Nell
explained
,
her
face
suddenly
tensing
.
"
Look
!
"
Down
one
of
the
corridors
appeared
a
black-clad
figure
,
face
covered
by
his
respirator
.
But
they
all
knew
it
was
Lawton
.
Another
figure
slipped
down
the
other
side
.
Delaney
set
the
mug
of
tea
down
.
"
What
the
hell
's
got
into
them
?
See
if
you
can
raise
them
on
the
radio
.
"
Grant
spoke
swiftly
into
his
transceiver
,
twice
calling
for
Lawton
or
Forster
to
respond
.
The
only
reaction
was
from
the
latter
,
his
masked
face
suddenly
turning
in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
cameras
.
He
gave
a
thumbs
up
sign
.
Grant
shook
his
head
.
"
Probably
ca
n't
make
us
out
.
Distortion
from
all
this
steel
.
"
Delaney
got
to
his
feet
and
reached
for
his
Uzi
.
"
They
'll
need
more
back
up
.
"
Limping
,
Grant
made
to
follow
.
Nell
brushed
past
him
.
"
I
'll
go
.
"
For
a
second
Delaney
hesitated
.
Nell
's
chin
came
up
.
"
You
're
suspect
medically
.
And
Martin
's
leg
is
no
better
.
Besides
he
's
better
with
the
electronic
wizardry
.
"
That
clinched
it
.
"
Come
on
.
"
Delaney
and
Nell
ran
down
the
stairs
,
ignoring
precautions
.
The
entrance
was
on
the
second
deck
,
a
large
double
door
now
wide
open
that
Delaney
remembered
from
before
,
thinking
at
the
time
that
it
led
to
a
storage
area
.
They
pulled
up
,
suddenly
cautious
,
and
looked
in
.
It
was
a
white
,
featureless
corridor
with
a
blank
"
T
"
junction
facing
them
.
Nell
glanced
towards
Delaney
,
feeling
the
unease
rise
in
her
like
a
fanned
fire
;
the
feeling
that
the
white
,
ordinary-looking
corridor
with
its
strip
lighting
and
featureless
walls
led
down
to
-
what
?
She
was
fearful
.
It
was
a
fear
that
she
sensed
not
with
her
intellect
,
more
with
her
body
,
as
though
the
very
cells
themselves
had
a
collective
memory
.
She
shivered
at
some
ill-defined
idea
,
drifting
past
out
of
reach
,
in
the
foggy
recesses
of
her
mind
.
But
she
had
no
more
time
for
abstract
thoughts
.
Delaney
snapped
on
his
gas
mask
.
Nell
reached
for
her
own
,
and
began
to
pull
it
over
her
head
.
The
claustrophobia
took
her
unawares
.
Not
since
the
first
time
in
the
gloomy
training
tunnel
deep
underground
had
the
panic
risen
in
her
as
the
rubber
closed
around
her
nose
and
mouth
,
momentarily
sealing
off
her
breathing
,
like
a
parasitic
thing
covering
her
face
.
She
got
control
of
herself
,
found
Delaney
pausing
,
and
looking
around
for
her
.
The
brighter
light
reflected
on
his
glass
eyepieces
,
gleamed
on
the
moulded
side
muzzle
of
the
respirator
.
She
shuddered
.
The
freakishness
of
their
own
appearance
seemed
entirely
appropriate
.
And
ominous
.
Grant
saw
them
immediately
,
traversing
the
same
passage
they
'd
seen
Forster
and
Lawton
follow
.
He
snatched
his
gaze
back
to
the
latter
.
Lawton
had
just
appeared
in
what
looked
like
an
operating
theatre
,
standing
motionless
in
the
corner
as
though
an
actual
operation
was
in
progress
and
he
was
an
unwelcome
intruder
.
Forster
slipped
in
beside
him
,
looking
around
,
and
moving
to
an
anaesthetic
machine
.
Grant
could
make
out
some
pretty
sophisticated-looking
electronic
hardware
massed
down
one
wall
in
addition
to
a
cardiac
visual
display
monitor
and
the
usual
paraphernalia
of
an
intensive
care
unit
.
Lawton
finally
moved
,
crossing
to
double
doors
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
.
He
looked
through
the
small
windows
,
then
motioned
for
Forster
to
join
him
.
Grant
instinctively
moved
closer
to
the
screen
,
sensing
the
excitement
in
Lawton
.
He
glanced
quickly
across
to
check
on
Delaney
and
Nell
,
and
was
turning
his
attention
back
to
the
others
,
when
he
frowned
.
On
the
flickering
screen
,
one
of
the
cell-like
doors
was
ajar
,
yet
he
was
sure
they
had
all
been
shut
.
He
watched
the
screen
,
struggled
to
get
the
frame-hold
to
work
,
all
the
while
keeping
an
eye
on
the
scene
in
the
operating
theatre
.
Lawton
and
Forster
finally
passed
from
view
through
the
doors
.
Grant
glanced
across
,
and
saw
that
Delaney
had
reached
another
"
T
"
junction
.
The
black-clad
figure
hesitated
then
turned
the
corner
.
But
whereas
the
others
had
gone
to
the
left
,
Delaney
went
to
the
right
.
Half-heartedly
,
Grant
used
his
transceiver
,
and
called
them
.
It
was
no
use
.
As
Nell
followed
,
the
rows
of
screens
for
the
first
time
were
blank
,
showing
no
signs
of
life
.
Grant
turned
his
attention
to
the
flickering
one
-
and
gaped
.
The
cell-like
door
was
now
open
.
Wide
open
.
Delaney
realised
they
were
lost
when
finally
,
after
innumerable
turnings
in
the
maze
of
corridors
,
they
came
to
a
dead
end
.
Nell
nudged
him
,
and
pointed
to
the
door
behind
her
.
It
was
a
lift
.
Delaney
nodded
,
and
thumbed
the
button
.
Immediately
the
doors
drew
open
.
Inside
Nell
took
a
position
by
the
panel
as
Delaney
shot
a
last
glance
around
the
corridor
;
then
followed
her
in
.
Forster
stood
before
the
row
of
suits
,
hanging
like
a
lie
of
petrified
robots
,
and
immediately
recognised
them
for
what
they
were
;
instantly
realised
the
enormous
risk
they
might
all
be
running
,
at
least
below
decks
.
Grant
saw
the
lift
door
open
and
Delaney
and
Nell
step
cautiously
out
,
directly
under
the
camera
.
He
could
see
the
surprise
,
the
awe
,
as
they
stopped
,
looking
at
something
he
could
not
see
.
But
the
camera
was
designed
to
guard
the
lift
entrance
,
and
not
show
what
lay
beyond
.
On
the
flickering
screen
just
to
the
right
,
light
suddenly
reflected
from
something
in
the
black
hole
of
the
cell-like
room
.
Even
though
it
caught
his
eyes
,
so
that
he
was
actually
watching
when
it
happened
,
the
figure
that
leapt
from
the
blackness
was
only
a
silvery
blur
,
moving
with
breathtaking
and
unreal
speed
.
Grant
,
stunned
,
sat
staring
at
the
cell
entrance
,
not
sure
if
he
had
imagined
what
he
'd
seen
,
or
not
.
"
It
's
a
submersible
.
For
really
deep
work
.
"
Delaney
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
hull
of
the
craft
that
looked
as
if
it
owed
more
to
space
technology
than
to
marine
engineering
.
Silently
,
Nell
regarded
the
white
,
steel
tube
with
a
sphere
at
one
end
and
set
with
two
"
V
"
observation
ports
surrounded
by
remote
control
grab
arms
,
and
saw
only
an
insect-like
thing
,
a
huge
preying
mantis
.
Delaney
heaved
himself
aboard
,
the
vessel
moving
gently
on
the
only-black
water
of
the
dock
.
"
I
wondered
why
my
ears
popped
in
the
lift
.
"
He
surveyed
the
section
of
Titron
's
hull
that
housed
the
submersible
.
The
roof
above
was
the
false
bottom
of
the
hold
.
"
This
part
's
pressurised
.
Keep
the
water
out
.
"
He
pulled
off
his
mask
and
looked
down
into
the
open
conning
tower
.
The
mass
of
instruments
was
like
the
cockpit
of
a
seven-four-seven
,
even
down
to
a
control
column
.
He
stepped
back
on
to
the
deck
.
From
the
water
lying
everywhere
the
storm
had
obviously
battered
the
unattended
diving
area
.
"
So
that
's
what
all
the
research
is
about
.
Some
sort
of
hush-hush
oceanography
,
probably
for
oil
.
Something
like
that
.
"
Nell
,
relieved
to
be
rid
of
it
,
followed
his
lead
and
pulled
off
her
own
mask
.
For
the
first
time
she
could
smell
the
dankness
and
the
odour
of
rotting
seaweed
.
The
place
was
like
a
cave
.
Her
brooding
sense
of
unease
would
n't
be
placated
by
his
explanation
.
Living
things
inhabited
caves
,
did
n't
they
?
A
large
wave
passed
.
As
Titron
lifted
,
the
black
water
in
the
dock
sucked
away
,
opening
up
a
drop
of
several
feet
,
only
to
be
followed
by
a
surge
upwards
.
The
submersible
rose
higher
in
the
dock
,
the
overflowing
sea
rushing
like
a
tide
over
their
boots
.
Pumps
cut
in
,
clearing
the
water
through
drains
.
Delaney
splashed
across
to
one
wall
where
a
mass
of
underwater
tackle
was
stored
.
There
were
racks
of
wet
suits
,
dry
suits
,
helmets
,
air
tanks
,
helium
,
oxygen
and
others
he
did
not
recognise
.
Pinned
to
the
wall
was
a
huge
contoured
map
,
with
alongside
it
,
in
graph
layout
,
a
profile
of
the
depth
of
the
ocean
floor
.
His
finger
found
a
precisely
outlined
section
delineated
in
red
marker
.
He
whistled
.
"
That

he
said
.
"
Wonder
how
the
hell
they
got
anything
up
from
there
.
"
Nell
stood
beside
him
.
"
Perhaps
they
"
re
not
bringing
it
up
.
But
putting
it
down
.
"
Delaney
turned
to
look
directly
at
her
.
"
Why
would
they
need
to
dump
out
in
this
God-forsaken
place
?
Nuclear
waste
is
disposed
of
at
much
shallower
depths
.
And
it
's
no
secret
.
"
Nell
shrugged
.
"
Just
a
suggestion
,
that
's
all
.
"
She
moved
on
,
leaving
him
looking
thoughtful
,
to
stand
in
front
of
a
hugely
monstrous
brilliant
orange
diving
suit
,
the
helmet
a
streamlined
dome
with
built-in
lamp
,
camera
,
and
gas
pressure
and
communication
lines
.
He
came
and
stood
at
her
side
,
pointing
at
two
circular
hatches
in
the
floor
flanked
by
handrails
,
with
massive
spheres
secured
nearby
.
"
They
have
everything
.
These
deep
suits
are
probably
used
in
conjunction
with
those
diving
bells
.
"
But
Nell
,
transfixed
by
the
giant
suits
before
her
,
was
hardly
listening
.
"
John
,
"
she
said
,
"
could
that
figure
they
saw
have
been
somebody
in
one
of
these
?
"
"
No
way
,
"
he
grunted
.
"
If
it
was
,
the
man
could
hardly
have
moved
,
and
would
have
been
almost
totally
at
the
mercy
of
Silk
.
"
Nell
nodded
.
But
the
thought
persisted
,
and
would
n't
go
away
.
And
after
all
,
what
other
explanation
could
there
be
?
Grant
saw
Forster
and
Lawton
reappear
,
moving
back
the
way
they
had
come
.
For
a
shocked
moment
he
thought
Forster
was
carrying
a
man
over
his
shoulder
,
then
he
saw
what
it
was
,
and
understood
why
Lawton
was
weighed
down
with
cylinders
.
Nervously
his
eyes
flicked
over
the
screen
.
There
was
no
sign
of
the
silvery
man-like
thing
.
Forster
and
Lawton
passed
from
view
,
soon
to
reappear
in
another
corridor
.
Grant
scanned
the
still
empty
passages
behind
them
.
They
were
getting
well
clear
now
,
even
allowing
for
its
unnatural
speed
.
His
concentration
was
broken
by
a
sound
.
A
light
,
tinkling
sound
.
Grant
glanced
round
to
see
the
clipboards
on
the
wall
jingling
as
if
in
a
breeze
.
He
checked
the
two
sliding
doors
into
the
wheelhouse
.
They
were
still
tightly
closed
.
He
turned
back
in
time
to
see
Nell
and
Delaney
step
out
of
the
lift
.
Anxiously
he
watched
them
,
acutely
aware
that
they
were
no
longer
alone
in
the
maze
of
corridors
of
the
system
.
At
least
there
was
no
sign
of
the
creature
.
Grant
pushed
out
his
lower
lip
.
Creature
?
What
did
he
expect
?
Something
out
of
the
comic
books
?
The
clipboards
tinkled
again
,
but
he
did
n't
bother
to
turn
round
this
time
.
"
This
must
be
the
main
thoroughfare
.
"
Nell
surveyed
the
double
width
corridor
they
had
stumbled
upon
.
They
began
opening
every
door
as
they
walked
up
its
length
.
Laboratory
after
laboratory
presented
itself
,
each
stacked
with
equipment
of
all
types
.
Nell
guessed
from
the
centrifuges
and
freezers
what
type
of
work
they
had
been
designed
for
.
She
said
nothing
to
Delaney
at
that
moment
about
her
growing
suspicion
.
The
end
of
the
wide
corridor
was
guarded
by
double
doors
with
a
warning
symbol
on
either
side
of
them
.
Nell
recognised
it
,
but
a
sign
also
spelled
out
the
message
:
DANGER
.
BIO-HAZARD
.
Delaney
hesitated
,
but
Nell
,
used
to
it
in
hospital
laboratories
,
pushed
on
through
.
Immediately
facing
them
was
a
large
electronic
diagram
covering
the
wall
.
At
the
bottom
,
a
yellow
light
marked
the
entrance
.
Nell
tapped
it
with
her
finger
.
"
It
's
a
diagram
of
the

.
We
're

"
She
pointed
.
"

Delaney
nodded
,
his
eyes
taking
in

the

Delaney
asked
,
tapping
his
finger
.
When
Nell
did
n't
reply
,
he
turned
to
see
if
she
had
heard
him
;
found
her
staring
fixedly
at
the
sign
.
"
You
put
on
a
head
and
face
cover
,

she
explained
almost
mechanically
,
"

into
a
chamber
naked
,
and
come
out
covered
in
white
powder

Does

.
"
Delaney
was
staggered
.
"
Is
this
common
then
in
bio-research
?
"
"
No
.
In
fact
,
I
only
know
of
one
in
the
whole
of
the
UK
.
"
She
hesitated
.
"
And
that
's
at
Porton
Down
.
"
He
did
n't
require
further
explanation
,
for
he
knew
that
Porton
Down
was
the
MOD
's
research
station
into
micro-biological
and
chemical
warfare
.
Delaney
swallowed
,
suddenly
realising
the
implication
,
the
reason
why
Nell
's
face
was
white
behind
her
re-donned
mask
.
When
at
last
he
spoke
,
his
voice
was
tight
,
fully
realising
that
the
respirators
they
were
wearing
were
inadequate
for
most
nerve
gases
.
"
Are
we
at
risk
?
"
Nell
shrugged
,
felt
her
legs
weakening
.
"
It
's
possible
,
"
she
admitted
.
"
It
could
be
the
answer
to
your
missing
crew
.
"
Delaney
faced
her
squarely
.
"
How
do
you
mean
exactly
?
"
"
There
may
have
been
some
leak
,
causing

,

"
Delaney
felt
dizzy
,
trying
to
fight
down
the
rising
imagination
that
would
produce
symptoms
out
of
nothing
.
"
Why
have
n't
we
been
affected
up
to
now

"
Even
as
he
said
it
he
remembered
.
Nell
saw
it
in
his
eyes
,
and
nodded
.
"
Maybe
that
's
what
happened
to
you
in
the
engine

She
faltered
,
looking
down
at
her
hands
.
"

've
been
upset
and
uneasy

residual
pockets

it
left

Delaney
turned
back
to
the
electronic
display
.
"
In
that
case
would
n't
it
have
been
equally
lethal
to
us

Nell
shook
her
head
slowly
.
"
Not
necessarily
.
The
storm
and
passing
of
time
would
have
caused
its

dilution

is
another
possible
factor

Her
eye
caught
something
on
the
video
display
,
the
shock
transferring
to
Delaney
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
She
seemed
to
be
staring
,
transfixedly
,
at
the
lowest
part
of
the
laboratory
complex
,
at
a
bright
light
that
had
flickered
on
.
Even
as
he
found
it
,
it
went
dull
then
cut
out
again
,
as
though
there
was
a
bad
connection

He
guessed
immediately
.
"

ship

Nell
nodded

Delaney
looked
at

in
disbelief
.
"

Nell
seemed
to
collect
herself
.

She
paused
to
nod
,
more
to
confirm
it
to
herself
than
Delaney
.
"

can
take

Thoughts
raced
in
his
head
,
jostling
for
priority
.
Whitehall
would
have
known
,
but
he
'd
been
told
nothing
.
Why
?
Delaney
remembered
the
feeling
he
had
had
that
Connors
was
holding
something
back
.
That
something
began
to
take
shape
in
his
thoughts
.
G9
had
not
only
secured
Titron
-
it
had
also
been
a
probe
.
When
they
were
relieved
they
would
be
debriefed
.
Relieved
?
Another
crew
?
He
suddenly
went
cold
,
with
a
dreadful
certainty
.
There
never
would
be
a
relief
crew
.
Ever
!
He
looked
at
Nell
,
and
saw
that
she
had
reached
the
same
conclusion
.
He
tried
to
smile
.
"
Seems
like
we
might
be
made
redundant
.
"
He
guessed
that
when
they
made
their
report
,
probably
by
radio
to
a
close
in-surface
unit
,
the
MOD
would
finish
the
job
and
order
the
destruction
of
the
Titron
.
And
there
would
be
no
survivors
.
They
could
never
risk
it
.
Nell
felt
despair
enfold
her
.
She
was
desolate
.
Death
-
she
had
so
longed
for
it
that
she
hardly
gave
it
a
second
thought
.
But
she
did
n't
want
it
to
happen
to
him
.
She
was
so
poorly
versed
in
the
emotions
that
she
failed
to
comprehend
its
true
nature

Love
.
Anger

found
her
voice

tightly

Grant
had
watched
them
standing
in
front
of
the
electronic
display
,
puzzling
at
the
excessive
time
they
seemed
to
be
wasting
.
He
checked
for
Lawton
and
Forster
,
saw
them
pass
the
entrance
again
.
They
would
be
with
him
in
no
time
.
Strangely
he
was
glad
about
that
.
It
was
difficult
to
explain
,
but
he
'd
been
uneasy
for
the
last
few
minutes
:
not
an
emotion
he
'd
ever
had
much
experience
of
before
.
And
it
was
n't
for
the
others
'
safety
.
It
was
as
though
an
aura
of
something
evil
was
present
,
reaching
out
to
him
.
He
became
suddenly
aware
of
a
strange
,
unpleasant
smell
.
Grant
sat
back
,
decided
to
use
his
transceiver
and
call
up
Lawton
,
hungry
for
the
sound
of
another
human
voice
.
He
reached
down
,
found
his
field
bag
-
and
saw
the
feet
behind
him
.
At
first
he
thought
they
were
some
sort
of
exotic
underwater
flippers
,
scaly
,
silvery
,
tailing
away
to
black
ends
with
claw-like
projections
.
It
was
only
when
they
tensed
,
curling
and
tightening
their
grip
on
the
floor
,
did
he
realise
they
were
alive
.
The
memory
of
the
fleetingly
seen
silver
man-shape
flashed
into
his
mind
.
Fearfully
,
he
looked
slowly
up
.
His
eyes
made
an
incredible
journey
.
What
they
saw
at
the
end
fundamentally
shocked
his
system
.
Lawton
led
the
way
up
to
the
bridge
,
Forster
with
the
body
,
as
Grant
had
first
thought
,
over
his
shoulder
.
Lawton
suspected
nothing
,
merely
practised
caution
because
it
was
trained
into
him
and
was
not
an
instinct
.
He
reached
the
level
of
the
bridge
,
swung
his
back
to
the
wall
,
covering
the
ladder
they
had
just
used
as
Forster
made
for
the
door
.
In
an
instant
Forster
saw
a
flash
of
silvery
light
;
sensed
the
wrongness
.
He
threw
off
his
load
,
unslung
his
Uzi
and
ripped
open
the
door
.
Going
through
the
chart
room
curtains
,
half
enveloped
by
them
,
was
a
shape
-
the
back
of
a
man
?
-
something
,
just
disappearing
from
view
,
and
moving
with
incredible
speed
.
Forster
fired
a
quick
burst
from
the
hip
,
bullets
ripping
and
splintering
fabric
and
wood
,
ricocheting
dangerously
from
the
steel
wall
.
He
leapt
forward
,
intent
on
hot
pursuit
,
and
caught
sight
of
Grant
-
or
rather
,
what
was
left
of
him
.
Everything
went
from
his
mind
,
only
the
sense
to
rip
off
his
mask
before
the
vomit
came
.
Finally
,
Lawton
stood
beside
him
.
"
What
in
God
's
name
could
do
that
?
"
Somewhere
far
below
a
door
slammed
.
They
'd
talked
little
on
the
way
back
,
Delaney
desperately
trying
to
find
another
reason
,
however
unlikely
,
for
Connors
not
briefing
him
fully
.
He
wanted
a
way
out
-
for
Nell
's
sake
.
But
his
tortured
mind
could
only
come
to
the
same
conclusion
.
G9
were
expendable
.
By
definition
.
So
when
the
proverbial
shit
had
hit
the
fan
in
Whitehall
,
Connors
,
or
somebody
like
him
,
would
have
drawled
at
the
emergency
conference
.
"
I
've
just
the
answer
.
That
little
known
unit
we
've
always
had
-
bunch
of
misfits
,
really
.
They
'll
be
glad
of
the
action
.
They
can
give
us
a
full
report
-
"
Six
months
later
,
Delaney
had
lit
tie
doubt
that
the
tragic
explosion
of
an
oil
tanker
in
mid
ocean
would
have
long
since
been
forgotten
,
and
Connors
,
or
whoever
,
would
be
in
the
New
Year
's
Honours
List
.
Could
he
really
complain
?
After
all
,
it
was
true
.
They
were
a
specialist
group
trained
for
long-shot
missions
,
usually
with
appalling
odds
.
But
duplicity
?
To
be
sent
callously
,
unwittingly
to
their
deaths
like
laboratory
animals
.
Anger
on
a
slow
fuse
began
to
build
.
At
least
,
he
thought
,
Nell
would
survive
.
He
'd
see
to
that
somehow
.
They
'd
just
set
foot
back
in
the
ship
proper
when
the
burst
of
machine
gun
fire
rooted
them
to
the
spot
.
When
the
moment
passed
,
Delaney
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
.
The
bridge
door
was
wide
open
.
As
he
breasted
the
deck
level
Delaney
ducked
back
,
threw
himself
aside
at
the
sight
of
the
figure
sprawled
on
the
ground
.
A
micro-second
later
his
brain
finally
perceived
the
detail
.
The
figure
did
n't
move
;
was
twisted
unnaturally
.
Cautiously
he
mounted
the
remaining
stairs
,
recognised
the
figure
for
what
it
was
and
stepped
over
it
to
the
wheelhouse
.
Lawton
met
him
and
reported
grimly
.
"
Grant
's
dead
.
Attacked
by
the
same
thing
that
got
Silk
.
Or
so
we
think
.
"
He
stood
back
and
made
way
for
him
.
Delaney
stepped
into
the
wheelhouse
,
his
eyes
taking
in
the
smashed
console
,
then
dropping
down
to
the
grisly
,
earthly
remains
of
Grant
.
He
knew
then
that
the
mystery
of
Titron
was
only
partly
explained
by
the
secret
biological
warfare
establishment
.
There
was
another
reason
why
the
ship
would
not
-
could
not
-
be
allowed
to
live
.
Something
utterly
alien
and
beyond
comprehension
had
been
born
in
Titron
's
belly
.
And
that
something
was
obscene
,
deadly
,
and
now
-
free
.
Grant
's
remains
were
shovelled
into
a
canvas
bag
.
Tense
,
facing
outwards
,
Forster
,
Lawton
and
Nell
guarded
Delaney
as
he
intoned
the
seaman
's
prayer
of
interment
,
and
then
committed
the
canvas
bag
to
the
ocean
.
The
storm
was
abating
rapidly
,
the
evening
sky
clearing
in
the
west
with
the
golden
rays
of
the
setting
sun
adding
a
dying
colour
to
the
sullen
slate
blue
water
.
The
whiteness
of
the
canvas
body-bag
dimmed
beneath
the
onrushing
sea
,
faded
at
the
edges
,
then
grew
smaller
,
greener
,
and
was
gone
.
They
returned
to
the
bridge
,
fearful
of
every
dark
place
-
every
corner
,
every
door
.
The
gangway
lamps
seemed
to
give
no
light
,
only
add
further
to
the
gloom
of
the
dusk
.
Back
in
the
wheelhouse
,
Delaney
faced
them
.
"
Right
.
You
all
know
the
score
.
As
I
see
it
we
've
got
two
choices
.
One
,
we
get
out
of
here
now
.
Launch
the
lifeboat
,
take
our
chances
,
or
-
two
,
we
go
after
whatever
it
is
.
"
Nobody
spoke
immediately
.
Finally
Forster
glanced
at
Lawton
for
support
,
and
drawled
laconically
.
"
I
'm
not
leaving
here
until
we
've
done
for
that
bastard
.
It
's
personal
from
now
on
in
!
"
Lawton
nodded
his
agreement
.
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
feel
the
same
.
"
"
Nell
?
"
Delaney
asked
,
looking
at
her
squarely
.
"
I
agree
,
"
she
said
without
hesitation
.
Their
tense
,
edgy
faces
watched
Delaney
closely
.
"
We
do
n't
know
what
we
're
up
against
,
"
Delaney
said
,
"
so
let's
proceed
with
maximum
caution
.
"
"
Trouble
is
,
"
Lawton
said
,
with
a
frown
,
"
there
are
n't
enough
of
us
to
search
the
ship
.
It
can
work
its
way
past
us
,
and
hide
again
.
We
could
still
be
looking
for
it
when
they
blow
us
out
of
the
water
.
"
"
That
's
why
we
've
got
to
take
risks
,
"
Nell
put
in
.
"
Lure
it
into
a
trap
,
somehow
.
And
quickly
.
Forster
's
chuckle
was
mirthless
.
"
I
do
n't
think
this
joker
is
going
to
need
much
encouragement
.
"
"
No
.
"
Delaney
was
momentarily
thoughtful
.
"
What
had
you
in
mind
,
Nell
?
"
She
pointed
to
the
figure
of
a
man
propped
in
the
corner
,
and
the
cylinders
of
oxygen
in
the
back
pack
lying
beside
it
.
"
Two
of
our
number
have
been
killed
.
Each
time
when
they
were
on
their
own
.
Let's
give
it
the
same
conditions
,
only
this
time
we
use
that
as
the
bait
.
"
They
looked
at
the
"
man
"
Forster
had
found
.
It
was
a
safety
suit
,
an
advanced
model
of
the
NBC
type
with
its
own
oxygen
tanks
.
"
One
in
ambush
,
with
the
rest
of
us
acting
like
beaters
.
Start
at
one
end
of
the
ship
,
making
as
much
noise
as
possible
.
"
Forster
grunted
.
"
It
had
no
trouble
finding
Grant
.
I
think
it
's
a
good
idea
.
And
I
'll
go
in
the
suit
until
we
reach
the
ambush
point
.
Might
help
to
draw
it
.
"
They
helped
him
kit
up
,
Nell
connecting
the
leads
from
the
back
pack
into
the
suit
attachments
.
Forster
's
breathing
whistled
out
of
the
one-way
valve
.
Behind
the
clear
,
wide
vizor
,
he
tried
to
smile
.
"
Cosy
in
here
,
"
he
joked
.
"
Even
got
my
own
toilet
.
Bloody
handy
in
the
circumstances
.
"
Delaney
took
the
lead
.
It
was
now
light
,
the
lamps
on
the
gangway
giving
murky
yellow
pools
that
barely
pushed
back
the
inky
blackness
of
a
starless
night
.
At
the
entrance
to
the
laboratory
complex
the
others
drew
on
their
own
masks
.
Ineffectual
or
not
against
lingering
gases
it
seemed
a
wise
precaution
,
even
if
it
was
only
psychological
.
Delaney
glanced
back
at
them
.
"
Let's
make
sure
it
knows
where
we
are
.
"
They
made
noise
;
slammed
doors
.
Nell
shuddered
.
Were
unseen
eyes
watching
them
?
Was
it
even
now
shadowing
them
,
moving
soundlessly
from
cover
to
cover
,
like
a
tiger
in
the
steel
jungle
?
Forster
's
radio-projected
voice
broke
into
her
thoughts
.
"
Looks
a
good
place
.
"
He
was
at
the
entrance
to
the
secure
lab
zone
.
"
This
must
be
the
only
way
in
,
"
Nell
said
.
Forster
was
quickly
de-suited
.
As
they
set
up
the
now
empty
suit
with
its
back
to
the
door
,
half
slumped
over
a
control
panel
,
he
settled
down
behind
the
curtained
entrance
of
the
showers
.
Delaney
's
voice
was
hushed
.
"
Maybe
we
should
leave
two
of
us
here
?
"
"
Do
n't
want
to
rouse
any
suspicions
.
Forster
was
adamant
.
"
After
all
,
it
might
be
able
to
count
.
"
When
he
did
n't
get
any
response
,
he
patted
the
Uzi
beside
him
on
the
steel
floor
.
"
I
wo
n't
be
unprepared
like
poor
old
Grant
.
"
Delaney
pulled
the
curtain
across
,
covering
Forster
who
cut
a
small
slit
in
the
opaque
green
plastic
,
widening
it
to
give
himself
a
better
field
of
view
.
Lawton
came
and
crouched
down
in
front
of
it
.
"
I
've
left
the
suit
's
radio
on
full
,
"
he
said
.
"
Make
it
sound
interesting
if
we
talk
occasionally
.
"
He
hesitated
.
"
Good
luck
.
"
"
I
feel
like
a
Maharajah
waiting
for
the
tiger
to
pounce
on
the
tied-up
goat
,
"
Forster
grinned
.
"
I
hope
I
do
n't
have
to
wait
all
night
.
"
Nell
shuddered
.
Night
.
This
was
a
night
in
their
minds
-
a
creature
from
the
darker
side
of
man
's
intellect
.
Something
worried
her
about
that
thought
.
Something
hidden
behind
the
more
obvious
sentiment
.
After
they
'd
gone
,
Forster
felt
the
silence
physically
settle
around
him
.
He
'd
never
been
one
to
exercise
an
over-imagination
,
yet
the
conditions
were
like
the
feeling
of
a
tomb
-
of
an
interment
.
Would
he
be
found
,
he
mused
,
a
thousand
years
from
then
,
a
dust-covered
skeleton
?
He
chuckled
.
And
the
Uzi
a
primitive
weapon
,
the
bio
suit
mistaken
for
some
sort
of
ceremonial
armour
?
The
first
stunning
silence
gave
way
to
the
creaking
of
the
ship
and
a
far-off
booming
of
the
sea
against
the
hull
.
The
radio
on
the
dummy
suddenly
screeched
into
action
as
Delaney
's
distorted
voice
gave
it
life
.
The
thousands
of
tons
of
steel
made
real
communication
impossible
.
His
own
radio
was
off
.
Forster
settled
down
,
only
putting
his
eye
to
the
slit
every
half
minute
,
not
continually
as
he
had
started
to
do
.
He
had
a
good
view
of
the
long
shadowy
main
corridor
.
The
only
problem
was
if
-
he
corrected
himself
-
when
it
came
,
which
side
turning
,
if
any
,
would
it
use
.
The
further
away
the
better
.
The
more
time
to
see
it
approach
.
The
trouble
was
the
transverse
corridor
just
outside
the
room
.
If
the
approach
was
that
way
he
would
get
no
warning
at
all
,
and
it
would
be
on
top
of
George
-
his
name
for
the
dummy
sitting
like
a
drunken
son-of-a-bitch
-
before
he
knew
it
.
If
that
happened
,
he
'd
have
to
work
fast
.
What
he
'd
seen
done
to
Grant
made
Forster
realise
that
whatever
it
was
struck
with
demonic
speed
and
savagery
.
In
seconds
,
poor
old
George
would
be
spread
around
the
room
like
an
explosion
in
Harrod
's
window
,
and
the
thing
would
be
away
.
Or
on
him
.
as
if
in
protest
,
George
uttered
a
blood-curdling
,
lunatic-sounding
cackle
,
and
fell
fractionally
forward
.
Forster
suppressed
a
nervous
giggle
.
They
reached
the
main
deck
,
dropping
down
in
a
defensive
posture
,
eyes
searching
the
stacked
containers
,
trying
to
probe
the
black
,
jagged
recesses
between
them
.
Lawton
scanned
upwards
.
"
It
could
be
anywhere
.
Even
back
on
the
bridge
again
.
"
"
We
should
start
in
the
engine
room
,
"
Nell
suggested
,
shivering
,
"
work
up
through
the
crew
's
quarters
,
and
then
into
the
complex
.
"
Confronted
with
the
need
to
proceed
,
Delaney
took
risks
,
plummeting
feet
first
through
the
hatchways
,
and
partly
breaking
his
descent
with
the
handrails
,
falling
like
a
parachutist
,
rolling
instantly
deploying
his
Uzi
against
-
Against
what
?
Like
Forster
,
all
he
could
guess
was
that
it
was
fast
.
Grant
may
have
been
lame
,
but
-
fast
or
silent
?
Or
both
?
The
speed
of
descent
must
have
cut
down
the
exposure
to
any
residual
gas
since
he
felt
none
of
the
earlier
weirdness
as
he
approached
the
still
sealed
engine
room
door
.
Pandora
's
Box
?
He
winced
at
the
memory
as
he
hammered
on
the
steel
and
then
looked
through
the
spy
port
.
In
the
stroboscopic
view
,
the
giant
pistons
were
the
only
things
moving
-
until
a
figure
detached
itself
from
the
wall
,
its
grey
colour
exactly
that
of
the
background
steel
.
Like
a
chameleon
,
it
moved
out
of
the
aisle
between
machines
,
then
stopped
,
and
became
utterly
motionless
.
Delaney
's
stillness
caught
the
attention
of
the
others
.
Nell
's
transceivered
voice
crackled
in
his
headphones
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
He
did
n't
want
to
take
his
eyes
from
it
-
equally
he
wanted
somebody
else
to
see
it
.
To
confirm
.
Gently
as
though
he
might
disturb
it
,
he
pulled
back
.
"
Take
a
look
for
yourself
.
"
She
did
-
and
caught
her
breath
.
The
creature
was
large-headed
,
absurdly
so
,
its
body
half
man
,
half
something
lost
in
the
primordial
past
.
But
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
fundamentally
it
was
-
human
.
Nell
knew
,
and
not
only
because
she
was
a
female
of
the
same
species
.
She
could
see
in
its
eyes
-
intelligence
.
And
human
fear
.
But
also
,
as
a
doctor
,
she
knew
exactly
what
it
was
.
She
told
Delaney
,
who
shook
his
head
with
revulsion
.
Nell
would
never
rest
until
she
could
get
closer
to
confirm
her
worst
suspicions
,
and
paradoxically
it
was
the
woman
in
her
that
provided
the
intensity
of
emotion
that
would
let
nothing
stand
in
her
way
.
George
,
the
sacrificial
dummy
,
had
n't
emitted
a
squeak
for
a
long
time
.
Forster
scanned
the
corridor
once
more
.
It
was
empty
.
just
as
it
always
had
been
.
He
sat
back
again
,
eyeing
the
blank
wall
before
him
,
confident
that
he
'd
catch
it
,
however
good
it
was
.
He
kept
wondering
how
it
had
got
Silk
.
Silk
was
the
meanest
,
toughest
professional
he
'd
ever
known
.
And
yet
he
'd
disappeared
,
without
trace
.
Forster
was
a
fatalist
.
He
shrugged
.
You
could
be
James
Bond
,
he
thought
,
but
if
something
had
your
number
on
it
-
A
gentle
breeze
broke
the
absolute
silence
,
moving
the
curtain
so
that
he
had
to
steady
it
with
his
hand
.
Instantly
alert
,
Forster
checked
through
his
spy
port
.
Nothing
.
But
a
door
had
opened
somewhere
.
Somebody
,
or
something
,
had
entered
the
complex
.
It
could
be
the
others
returning
-
or
the
start
of
his
ambush
.
"
For
God
's
sake
leave
your
mask
on
.
And
that
's
an
order
!
"
But
Delaney
's
plea
was
in
vain
.
Nell
pulled
it
off
,
got
close
to
the
door
,
and
shouted
.
"
We
mean
you
no
harm
.
You
can
help
us
.
"
When
she
checked
through
the
spyhole
it
was
standing
in
exactly
the
same
spot
,
unmoving
,
like
a
lizard
.
Lawton
shook
his
head
.
"
Ca
n't
hear
you
.
Try
the
ship
's
system
again
.
"
Nell
ran
to
the
wall
telephone
,
and
pushed
the
digit
for
engine
room
.
The
small
light
beneath
the
receiver
rests
showed
that
the
line
was
working
.
Worried
,
Delaney
followed
,
searching
her
face
,
fearing
the
tell-tale
signs
of
toxicity
.
On
impulse
,
and
against
his
better
judgment
,
he
pulled
off
his
own
mask
.
Nell
repeatedly
pressed
the
button
,
shouted
across
at
Lawton
,
who
was
now
using
the
spy
port
.
"
What
's
happening
?
"
The
back
of
Lawton
's
head
shook
,
his
radio-projected
voice
crackling
.
"
Nothing
now
.
The
head
jerked
,
just
the
once
,
to
the
left
,
so
I
reckon
it
heard
the
"
phone
.
"
He
straightened
up
and
came
over
,
directing
his
question
at
Delaney
.
"
We
ought
to
get
on
.
"
Delaney
nodded
his
agreement
.
"
Leave
it
,
Nell
.
"
His
tone
was
sharp
.
"
It
's
not
going
anywhere
.
"
She
squared
up
to
him
,
defiantly
,
"
I
ca
n't
,
John
.
Do
n't
you
see
?
The
poor
thing
is
part
of
this
madness
.
If
we
can
get
to
it
,
I
can
learn
so
much
more
.
And
in
any
case
,
it
might
die
if
we
do
n't
try
and
help
it
-
soon
.
"
Delaney
averted
his
gaze
from
her
,
afraid
of
what
he
had
seen
in
her
eyes
.
"
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
it
did
.
"
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
she
said
,
stepping
away
from
him
.
Delaney
fiddled
awkwardly
with
his
mask
,
preparatory
to
putting
it
back
on
again
.
"
For
God
's
sake
,
Nell
.
All
I
mean
is
,
we
've
got
a
job
to
do
.
And
Forster
's
neck
's
on
the
line
.
Do
n't
you
owe
it
to
him
to
come
now
?
"
She
flushed
,
but
held
on
to
the
"
phone
.
Obviously
striving
to
be
as
controlled
as
possible
,
she
smiled
.
"
You
two
can
manage
,
"
she
said
calmly
.
"
I
can
do
better
here
,
on
my
own
.
Quietly
.
If
I
succeed
it
will
unlock
a
lot
of
the
mystery
of
what
's
been
done
on
Titron
.
And
-
"
She
faltered
.
"
-
I
think
we
owe
it
to
that
pathetic
creature
in
there
.
"
"
Pathetic
?
"
Delaney
tried
to
play
down
the
fear
in
his
voice
-
fear
for
her
.
"
It
might
be
bloody
dangerous
.
Certainly
,
something
on
this
ship
is
.
"
"
Not
this
one
,
"
Nell
said
,
shaking
her
head
with
some
kind
of
reassurance
.
"
I
just
know
.
"
Lawton
gestured
in
the
gangway
.
"
You
may
not
be
at
risk
from
what
is
in
here
.
What
about
out
there
?
There
's
no
guarantee
that
what
we
're
hunting
is
going
to
follow
the
rules
.
"
Nell
shrugged
.
"
That
's
a
risk
I
'll
have
to
take
.
I
've
got
a
more
important
job
here
.
"
Delaney
knew
there
was
no
way
she
would
be
shifted
from
her
chosen
course
.
Ordering
her
would
be
ludicrous
under
the
changed
circumstances
,
and
in
any
event
,
a
waste
of
time
.
But
Lawton
was
right
.
The
risk
from
the
other
danger
,
or
dangers
of
Titron
,
frightened
him
more
.
"
Help
me
secure
the
stairs
behind
us
,
"
he
snapped
at
Lawton
,
"
as
much
as
we
can
.
"
Delaney
turned
to
Nell
.
"
It
might
buy
you
the
time
you
need
.
But
take
care
.
Do
n't
be
bloody
foolish
like
I
am
,
leaving
you
here
.
Establish
contact
if
you
can
.
No
more
at
this
stage
.
Understand
?
And
do
n't
try
and
get
the
door
open
.
"
But
Nell
was
hardly
listening
.
To
please
him
she
nodded
,
then
despite
Lawton
's
presence
,
squeezed
Delaney
's
arm
.
"
And
you
.
"
She
smiled
.
"
Watch
out
.
"
Reluctantly
,
Delaney
made
for
the
gangway
.
Lawton
had
already
shifted
some
chairs
,
in
readiness
to
form
a
barricade
.
He
gave
him
a
hand
with
a
large
oil
drum
,
and
then
another
,
as
Nell
,
tearing
herself
from
her
appointed
task
,
dragged
over
a
bench
.
As
they
drew
back
up
the
stairs
,
piling
on
the
pieces
she
threw
up
at
them
,
Lawton
sniffed
.
"
This
wo
n't
hold
anything
.
Just
slow
it
down
.
"
Like
Forster
before
her
,
Nell
indicated
her
pistol
and
grenades
.
"
As
long
as
there
's
ti
me
,
that
's
all
we
need
.
"
As
they
descended
the
stairs
,
Delaney
paused
,
and
took
a
last
look
down
at
her
.
She
smiled
shyly
,
then
turned
away
.
In
a
sense
,
as
long
as
he
could
convince
himself
that
she
was
safe
,
he
was
glad
she
was
n't
coming
with
them
.
Whatever
it
was
they
were
after
,
it
was
an
unknown
quantity
,
unknown
,
that
is
,
except
for
a
lethal
ferocity
.
He
pulled
on
his
respirator
,
his
mind
made
up
to
get
back
to
her
as
soon
as
he
could
,
for
Nell
Anderson
was
all
he
cared
about
now
.
There
it
went
again
.
Forster
frowned
as
he
looked
through
his
spy
hole
.
A
sound
.
He
could
n't
place
it
,
but
it
reminded
him
strongly
of
something
.
The
corridor
was
empty
.
It
had
happened
three
times
now
.
A
hissing
,
We
gas
escaping
,
ending
with
a
funny
little
squeak
.
He
looked
at
George
,
wondering
if
the
sound
had
come
from
him
.
Satisfied
that
everything
was
as
it
should
be
,
he
checked
his
watch
.
Well
over
half
an
hour
had
passed
.
They
ought
to
be
near
him
soon
.
Forster
searched
in
a
pouch
and
came
up
with
a
glucose
sweet
.
Quietly
he
unwrapped
the
covering
paper
,
then
paused
,
as
some
instinct
made
him
check
again
.
As
he
did
so
,
the
sound
came
nearer
;
louder
.
His
intense
scrutiny
took
in
the
shadowy
and
empty
lengths
of
the
corridor
.
Apart
from
some
dark
patches
on
the
wall
that
he
had
n't
noticed
before
,
there
was
nothing
to
see
.
His
gaze
came
back
to
George
,
still
sprawled
over
the
control
desk
.
A
fly
landed
on
the
empty
,
staring
vizor
,
and
crawled
across
it
.
Forster
was
sorely
tempted
to
nip
out
and
confirm
that
the
noise
was
coming
from
George
by
twiddling
the
volume
and
tuner
,
but
fought
down
the
urge
.
He
sat
back
,
pulled
off
his
mask
,
and
popped
the
sweet
into
his
mouth
.
It
took
him
only
seconds
to
notice
the
smell
.
Forster
choked
as
the
putrefying
reek
seemed
to
get
right
into
him
.
Frightened
that
it
was
a
gas
pocket
,
he
fumbled
with
his
mask
,
and
finally
got
it
back
on
.
His
heart
was
thumping
.
Nothing
seemed
to
be
happening
,
all
his
senses
were
apparently
functioning
normally
,
except
-
that
the
sweet
in
his
mouth
seemed
permeated
with
the
awful
smell
;
had
become
a
slimy
lump
of
filth
.
He
had
to
get
rid
of
it
.
Forster
reached
for
his
mask
,
just
as
the
hissing
gas
noise
sounded
right
on
top
of
him
,
ending
with
a
little
shriek
.
He
knew
then
where
he
'd
heard
something
similar
before
.
It
was
like
a
man
breathing
through
a
respiratory
system
,
with
some
sort
of
one-way
valve
.
A
shadow
fell
across
the
wall
opposite
,
as
slowly
,
and
fearfully
he
turned
.
The
curtain
was
a
dense
,
opaque
greenish-yellow
,
and
something
was
right
behind
it
,
a
shape
pressing
against
the
humped
plastic
standing
there
looking
down
at
him
,
half
seen
,
half
imagined
.
His
hand
went
out
,
reached
for
the
submachine
gun
,
his
fingers
tightening
on
the
stock
.
With
a
blood-curdling
growl
,
the
curtain
was
snatched
aside
.
Forster
half
rolled
,
his
Uzi
trembling
in
his
hand
as
he
got
off
half
a
clip
at
point
blank
range
.
But
it
struck
with
the
speed
of
an
attacking
snake
.
And
something
else
;
something
he
saw
as
the
curtain
tore
away
and
he
looked
into
the
depths
of
the
unbelievable
face
above
him
,
fractionally
dulled
his
reflexes
.
After
they
'd
gone
,
Nell
tried
a
different
tactic
.
She
disarmed
herself
,
putting
her
grenades
and
pistol
down
on
to
the
floor
,
and
standing
directly
in
front
of
the
spy
hole
,
but
some
ten
feet
away
.
Arms
down
at
her
sides
,
palms
forward
,
she
waited
.
It
was
just
possible
for
her
to
see
a
suggestion
of
light
at
the
spy
hole
,
set
like
a
marble
in
the
wall
.
She
continued
to
stare
at
it
as
the
minutes
passed
.
There
was
no
other
way
she
could
think
of
,
except
to
show
the
obscene
and
pathetic
distortion
of
humanity
that
she
came
in
peace
.
It
was
only
in
the
continuing
silence
that
it
came
to
her
that
her
defenceless
back
was
presented
to
the
rest
of
the
room
.
Suddenly
,
she
began
to
hear
all
sorts
of
sounds
,
footsteps
and
slitherings
.
Angrily
,
she
fought
down
the
urge
to
turn
,
and
kept
her
eye
on
the
bead
of
light
,
willing
the
pathetic
creature
beyond
to
come
to
it
.
Directly
before
her
was
a
large
wall
clock
.
The
second
hand
swept
monotonously
around
and
around
.
She
allowed
her
gaze
to
flick
up
every
time
the
hand
passed
the
twelve
.
She
found
it
eased
her
aching
eyes
.
It
had
passed
for
the
thirteenth
time
when
she
returned
her
attention
to
the
bead
of
light
,
and
caught
her
breath
.
The
little
star
twinkled
-
and
went
out
.
They
were
actually
in
the
prefabricated
complex
when
the
staccato
chatter
of
the
Uzi
echoed
through
the
steel
maze
like
the
sound
of
a
rivet
gun
.
Just
the
one
quick
burst
.
The
trap
had
been
sprung
!
Delaney
and
Lawton
threw
all
caution
,
all
training
,
to
the
wind
.
And
ran
.
At
first
,
Delaney
could
n't
see
anything
different
.
The
dummy
was
still
propped
over
the
desk
,
the
shower
curtain
drawn
.
Then
he
realised
the
shower
was
on
.
"
Gene
?
"
he
called
.
The
only
reply
was
the
steady
hissing
of
the
water
.
They
took
up
opposite
sides
of
the
room
,
approaching
the
concealing
curtain
with
extreme
caution
,
the
stubby
barrels
of
the
Uzi
submachine
gun
ready
to
blast
anything
that
leapt
forward
.
The
shower
hissed
on
.
Delaney
grasped
at
the
curtain
,
Lawton
crouching
for
a
better
angle
.
At
a
nod
from
Lawton
,
Delaney
snatched
the
curtain
back
.
Blood
from
Forster
's
broken
body
was
floating
away
in
clouds
,
finally
swirling
in
a
whirlpool
above
the
drain
.
His
injuries
were
horrendous
.
But
what
held
Delaney
and
Lawton
in
rigid
shock
was
the
lump
of
black
,
flesh-like
jelly
crawling
over
his
face
,
covering
it
like
some
huge
,
abnormal
slug
.
Delaney
recovered
first
,
unthinking
,
uncaring
of
danger
,
screaming
out
,
and
grabbing
the
slippery
,
obscene
filth
,
ripping
it
off
and
in
one
movement
throwing
it
hard
against
the
wall
.
With
a
splat
,
great
splits
opened
up
in
the
mass
.
It
slid
down
the
wall
,
leaving
behind
it
a
trail
of
dark
brown
juice
,
like
bile
.
Lawton
sucked
in
air
.
"
Christ
Almighty
!
"
Where
it
had
covered
Forster
's
face
,
his
neck
,
chin
,
mouth
,
nose
and
one
cheek
,
the
skin
and
lips
had
gone
,
as
if
etched
away
by
acid
.
Delaney
dropped
down
beside
him
,
ignoring
the
still
running
shower
,
to
plunge
his
hand
over
Forster
's
heart
.
"
He
's
still
alive
.
"
Forster
's
eyes
flickered
open
as
Lawton
began
to
pack
a
dressing
into
the
gaping
abdominal
wound
.
His
hand
,
still
surprisingly
strong
,
gripped
Lawton
's
wrist
.
"
Leave
it
-
too
late
.
"
He
coughed
,
a
great
wracking
of
torn
tissue
.
More
blood
appeared
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
.
His
eyes
found
those
of
Delaney
.
"
John
-
watch
out
.
This
one
-
not
-
natural
-
"
Coughing
intervened
.
When
it
stopped
,
Delaney
had
to
lean
closer
as
Forster
's
voice
dropped
to
a
grating
whisper
.
"
I
got
off
-
a
full
clip
.
Right
into
its
chest
.
Never
batted
an
eyelid
.
"
His
face
screwed
up
into
what
Delaney
thought
was
pain
,
but
suddenly
realised
it
was
an
attempt
at
a
grin
.
"
Sheer
luck
-
it
's
tagged
itself
with
one
of
these
.
"
His
hand
reached
up
,
flicked
feebly
at
one
of
Delaney
's
pouches
.
In
there
they
all
carried
a
small
radio
homing
device
,
to
find
each
other
blindly
if
necessary
.
The
hand
dropped
back
and
the
eyes
closed
.
Delaney
looked
up
at
Lawton
.
"
Did
you
get
that
?
"
Lawton
nodded
.
There
was
one
other
thing
that
Delaney
had
to
know
.
"
Turn
off
that
bloody
shower
,
"
he
snapped
at
Lawton
.
He
put
his
mouth
next
to
Forster
's
ear
.
"
Gene
,
what
does
it
look
like
?
"
The
eyes
remained
closed
.
Why
was
it
important
?
Delaney
did
n't
really
know
.
He
hated
himself
for
pressing
a
dying
friend
,
but
some
gut-fear
,
some
primordial
terror
drove
him
on
.
"
Gene
?
Can
you
hear
me
?
What
does
it
look
like
?
"
The
lipless
mouth
barely
moved
.
"
Silk
.
"
Forster
died
,
leaving
Delaney
and
Lawton
in
a
terrified
bewildered
silence
.
It
was
still
watching
her
.
Nell
stayed
as
she
was
for
a
long
time
,
then
had
an
inspiration
.
Slowly
she
raised
her
hands
,
unpicked
her
hair
,
and
let
it
fall
free
.
Did
it
,
she
wondered
,
know
the
difference
between
a
man
and
a
woman
?
There
had
been
signs
that
some
of
the
cabins
had
been
occupied
by
women
.
But
had
any
worked
in
the
laboratory
?
Been
close
to
the
thing
beyond
the
door
at
its
inception
?
She
resolved
to
try
everything
.
She
turned
,
came
slowly
around
until
she
was
facing
the
door
again
,
so
that
it
could
see
she
had
no
weapons
of
any
sort
-
knife
,
gun
,
grenade
.
The
observation
port
remained
dark
.
It
was
still
watching
.
What
should
she
do
next
?
There
seemed
to
be
only
one
thing
she
could
do
.
She
walked
slowly
towards
the
door
,
tapped
gently
,
then
stood
back
and
waited
.
After
a
couple
of
minutes
she
tried
again
.
But
the
observation
port
remained
relentlessly
black
.
Disappointment
began
to
turn
to
irritation
.
It
was
then
that
she
heard
a
whistling
noise
,
and
smelt
a
sickening
odour
.
Before
she
had
time
to
assimilate
anything
,
from
the
top
of
the
gangway
came
a
terrible
growl
-
deep
,
huge
,
more
frightening
in
its
ferocity
than
any
wild
animal
she
'd
ever
heard
.
The
nearest
she
could
recall
was
the
booming
of
the
big
'gators
in
the
Florida
swamps
where
she
had
once
been
trained
.
But
it
was
more
than
a
growl
.
It
was
-
Footsteps
came
on
the
gangway
.
God
!
It
was
coming
down
for
her
.
Horror-struck
,
she
was
rooted
to
the
spot
with
terror
,
her
eyes
drawn
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
waiting
for
the
first
sign
.
Of
what
?
When
it
came
,
her
reaction
was
like
that
of
Grant
-
that
it
was
a
boot
;
part
of
a
sub-aquatic
suit
.
And
then
she
took
in
the
claw-like
ends
,
curling
inwards
to
grasp
the
stair
.
It
took
another
step
down
.
Huge
scaly
legs
,
moist
,
glistening
,
with
some
slimy
covering
that
she
instinctively
knew
was
giving
off
the
putrid
smell
.
An
arm
reached
down
.
The
hand
was
n't
like
the
feet
-
was
n't
human
;
was
n't
anything
natural
.
It
appeared
to
be
a
glove
that
was
hinged
at
the
joints
.
It
grabbed
a
chair
,
crunched
the
metal
-
like
paper
,
and
flung
it
aside
with
a
snarl
.
In
her
transfixed
state
,
physically
unable
to
move
,
Nell
's
thoughts
were
extraordinarily
clear
.
It
suddenly
came
to
her
-
the
hidden
meaning
in
her
thought
when
they
'd
left
Forster
taking
up
his
position
in
ambush
.
The
creature
from
the
darker
side
of
man
's
intellect
.
It
was
the
word
intellect
.
And
it
was
a
man
-
of
sorts
.
Therefore
it
had
an
intellect
.
And
a
cunning
of
its
own
.
At
that
precise
moment
,
Delaney
came
to
the
same
conclusion
as
Nell
.
They
had
n't
been
hunting
it
.
The
reverse
was
true
.
All
along
,
it
had
been
hunting
them
.
Again
,
another
chair
was
crumpled
and
flung
aside
.
An
oil
drum
was
kicked
away
,
rolling
and
crashing
into
the
wall
beside
her
.
Another
step
down
.
And
another
step
nearer
.
More
of
the
thickening
,
massive
legs
.
And
suddenly
she
was
no
longer
sure
that
it
was
scales
.
It
began
to
appear
more
convoluted
,
interlocking
chain
mail
-
some
sort
of
suit
.
But
the
slime
was
real
,
oozing
between
the
layers
.
One
more
step
and
she
would
be
confronted
by
its
face
-
a
face
that
would
encompass
her
own
death
.
The
moment
was
too
full
of
terror
,
of
crashes
and
grunts
,
for
her
to
hear
the
door
unlocking
behind
her
,
and
to
hear
it
swing
inwards
.
But
she
heard
the
thin
,
childlike
voice
with
its
very
sing-song
quality
,
cutting
across
the
stupefying
silence
after
another
huge
growl
.
"
In
here
!
"
As
the
creature
bent
lower
,
bringing
its
face
nearer
to
the
point
of
being
seen
,
she
turned
,
conscious
of
a
fleeting
impression
in
the
darkness
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
of
a
pair
of
blazing
eyes
.
It
must
have
seen
what
was
happening
,
for
with
a
great
scream
,
it
scattered
the
rest
of
the
barricade
,
like
matchwood
.
She
heard
it
crash
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
felt
the
floor
quiver
as
it
gained
on
her
.
Nell
tripped
on
the
edge
of
the
door
frame
,
fell
head-first
into
the
engine
room
,
and
was
conscious
of
something
scything
through
the
air
,
snatching
at
the
rubber
back
of
her
wet
suit
.
The
world
seemed
to
be
full
of
an
enraged
bellowing
,
then
the
door
slammed
,
cutting
off
the
noise
.
Silence
,
as
seconds
passed
.
Lying
on
the
floor
,
face
down
,
she
felt
around
at
her
back
.
The
rubber
had
been
cut
wide
open
,
as
though
slashed
by
a
surgeon
's
knife
.
She
felt
hot
moisture
.
Her
blood
.
The
shocked
priority
of
examining
herself
after
escaping
,
literally
,
from
the
jaws
of
death
,
wore
off
.
She
remembered
where
she
was
.
Remembered
her
unlikely
saviour
.
Under
the
duress
of
the
moment
,
the
act
of
crossing
the
threshold
into
this
place
had
passed
unnoticed
.
She
raised
her
head
and
looked
around
.
The
feet
were
by
the
door
,
small
,
ill-formed
,
like
wax
models
of
a
child
's
that
had
passed
through
flame
and
were
partially
melted
.
They
would
possess
none
of
the
inherent
tactile
and
balancing
powers
of
hers
,
or
that
creature
outside
.
Nell
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
rest
of
the
body
;
and
caught
her
breath
.
Her
guess
as
to
what
it
fundamentally
was
had
been
correct
.
As
a
doctor
she
'd
seen
others
like
it
before
.
So
many
times
.
But
never
in
the
normal
world
-
one
nearly
five
feet
tall
.
It
was
a
human
embryo
of
some
forty
days
that
had
been
somehow
arrested
,
then
grown
to
its
own
obscene
maturity
.
John
Delaney
knew
now
that
all
along
it
had
been
hunting
them
,
that
it
was
still
hunting
them
,
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
pick
them
off
at
will
,
one
at
a
time
.
One
at
a
time
!
"
Oh
God
!
Nell
.
"
He
sprang
upright
,
ran
,
not
caring
if
Lawton
was
with
him
or
not
.
Lawton
was
struggling
to
get
out
of
his
pack
the
receiver
that
would
pick
up
the
radio
signals
from
the
miniature
transceiver
Forster
said
was
attached
to
his
slayer
.
Switched
on
it
remained
silent
,
until
they
reached
the
deck
.
There
the
bleeping
came
through
loud
and
clear
.
"
John
.
"
Delaney
had
already
got
one
leg
over
the
door
frame
that
led
below
,
and
would
have
stopped
for
no
one
,
except
that
his
glance
took
in
the
obvious
truth
.
The
main
signal
strength
was
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
deck
cargo
.
"
Nell
's
all
right
,
"
Lawton
said
,
adding
:
"
It
's
over
here
and
moving
away
.
Delaney
paused
,
then
came
to
stand
beside
Lawton
,
watching
as
the
latter
swung
the
radio
direction
finder
in
a
small
arc
.
The
stronger
signal
came
from
the
port
side
.
"
No
heroics
,
"
Delaney
ordered
.
"
We
stick
together
.
"
"
What
are
we
going
to
do
when
we
make
contact
?
"
Lawton
asked
.
Delaney
took
out
the
remainder
of
his
plastic
explosives
.
"
Give
me
yours
.
We
'll
try
and
get
it
with
this
.
Failing
that
,
it
'll
be
phosphorus
grenades
.
"
Lawton
handed
over
his
plastic
,
then
found
the
two
phosphorus
grenades
they
each
carried
.
They
were
among
the
most
abhorrent
of
all
weapons
.
Exploding
phosphorus
landing
on
a
body
continued
to
burn
in
the
tissue
,
inflicting
indescribable
damage
.
Lawton
had
seen
the
effect
on
friend
and
foe
alike
.
Phosphorus
and
napalm
.
They
'd
kept
him
awake
for
many
an
hour
prior
to
an
op
.
Delaney
fixed
the
detonating
pins
into
the
plastic
,
using
the
remaining
length
of
wire
to
bind
it
to
the
timer
,
making
a
DIY
bomb
.
Sweating
profusely
,
he
set
the
fuse
to
just
less
than
two
seconds
.
They
both
knew
that
no
timer
could
be
relied
upon
to
be
that
sensitive
,
that
when
he
activated
it
,
the
chances
were
reasonable
that
it
would
detonate
instantly
-
before
he
could
throw
it
.
They
moved
into
the
first
,
pitch
black
canyon
,
faintly
lit
by
a
Poacher
's
Moon
,
their
passage
marked
by
the
persistent
bleeping
of
the
detector
.
In
the
sheltered
darkness
,
out
of
the
wind
,
it
seemed
to
grow
louder
and
more
piercing
.
At
every
corner
they
paused
,
checked
the
signal
strength
,
held
it
at
arm
's
length
to
see
if
they
could
detect
a
greater
strength
around
the
other
side
.
Grimly
,
Delaney
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
Half
an
hour
had
passed
.
as
if
to
set
the
final
scene
,
the
moon
now
rode
majestically
clear
of
the
clouds
,
forming
a
hard
,
bright
discus
in
the
star-pitted
blackness
of
the
night
.
A
blue
column
of
light
reflected
off
the
calm
sea
.
"
It
's
on
the
move
again
,
"
Lawton
whispered
.
"
Gone
to
the
left
.
"
They
followed
,
deep
now
among
the
containers
,
every
muscle
paining
from
their
constant
alertness
.
Twice
before
it
had
stopped
,
allowing
them
to
get
close
,
only
to
move
away
again
as
their
senses
had
reached
a
fever
pitch
of
readiness
.
Nagging
unease
began
to
seep
into
Delaney
's
weary
bones
.
What
was
it
up
to
?
"
It
's
stopped
again
,
"
Lawton
breathed
.
"
It
strikes
me
it
's
searching
for
something
.
"
"
Searching
?
"
Delaney
thought
about
it
,
and
decided
it
did
n't
make
sense
,
unless
it
was
looking
for
something
that
it
badly
needed
.
He
half
sensed
,
never
really
thought
it
though
,
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
looking
for
,
was
essential
to
its
very
existence
.
as
if
to
confirm
his
train
of
thought
there
came
a
great
crashing
and
a
screeching
of
metal
.
"
Sounds
as
if
it
's
trying
to
break
into
one
of
the
containers
.
"
Lawton
's
voice
was
tense
,
the
signal
bleeper
at
its
loudest
.
"
It
's
just
around
the
next
corner
.
And
it
's
stationary
.
"
Delaney
,
excited
,
gripped
Lawton
's
arm
.
"
That
's
it
.
What
do
you
reckon
they
hold
up
there
on
deck
?
"
Lawton
shrugged
.
"
Supplies
for
the
rest
of
the
ship
?
"
"
In
particular
?
"
Delaney
prompted
.
"
Of
course
.
All
the
stuff
that
lab
needs
would
be
housed
up
here

Easier

stocking
up
at
sea

"
And
that
creature
needs
something
.
If
we
time
it
right
we
'll
catch
it
with
its
pants
down
.
"
They
waited
,
listening
,
as
the
salty
night
air
with
the
sound
of
softly
hissing
waves
was
split
by
more
shearing
,
protesting
metal
,
and
deep
unearthly
growls
.
There
was
a
final
crash
,
then
silence
.
The
bleeper
kept
up
its
steady
,
plaintive
tone
.
"
It
's
torn
a
door
off
,
"
Delaney
whispered
.
"
And
gone
inside
.
"
"
Yes
,
"
Lawton
nodded
in
agreement
.
Delaney
swallowed
.
"
Ready
?
"
"
When
you
are
.
Torches
?
"
He
had
already
decided
"
yes
"
,
otherwise
it
would
be
impossible
to
throw
the
bomb
and
grenades
with
any
accuracy
.
He
knew
he
would
only
get
one
chance
with
the
plastic
.
They
pulled
the
chunky
torches
from
their
holsters
,
and
primed
them
for
high
output
.
They
would
burn
like
arc
lamps
for
a
very
short
duration
.
Delaney
took
hold
of
Lawton
's
shoulder
and
squeezed
in
time
as
he
counted
down
.
"
Three
.
Two
.
One
.
Go
!
"
They
leapt
up
screaming
,
zig-zagging
forward
in
the
classic
battle
charge
of
the
British
Army
.
Lawton
took
the
left
side
.
Delaney
the
right
.
The
brilliant
beams
of
their
torches
were
like
searchlights
,
swinging
wildly
for
a
second
,
until
they
finally
converged
at
the
back
of
a
container
with
its
door
ripped
open
and
lying
at
a
crazy
angle
.
And
inside
,
where
the
beams
of
the
torchlights
met
,
was
-
nothing
.
It
was
empty
!
Delaney
had
a
split
second
to
realise
that
all
along
it
had
been
setting
up
a
trap
for
them
.
Then
it
struck
,
and
all
hell
broke
loose
.
Nell
got
to
her
feet
and
finally
found
her
voice
.
"
Who
are
you
?
"
The
massive
head
,
still
with
the
marks
at
the
side
of
the
throat
where
the
gills
would
have
been
,
sighed
.
The
voice
was
tiny
,
forced
out
with
grunts
of
air
,
a
whistle
that
was
formed
into
words
that
were
as
incomplete
and
ill-defined
as
its
body
.
Nell
was
reminded
of
the
shrill
talk-whistles
of
dolphins
.
"
I
-
am
-
Piphros
.
"
It
sounded
mechanical
,
not
unlike
a
well-trained
parrot
.
"
Thank
you
for
saving
my
life
,
"
Nell
heard
herself
saying
.
"
What
was
that
out
there
?
"
The
weird
,
ill-formed
mouth
moved
again
,
and
ignoring
her
question
,
countered
with
its
own
.
"
I
-
do
-
not
-
know
-
you
.
"
Was
it
thinking
independently
,
or
just
mouthing
another
phrase
?
Nell
decided
to
push
her
medical
status
.
"
I
am
Doctor
Nell
Anderson
.
Some
of
us
were
airlifted
-
that
is
,
sent
-
to
see
what
had
gone
wrong
.
To
help
you
.
"
Nell
's
fears
grew
that
this
living
creature
that
was
neither
one
thing
or
truly
the
other
,
would
never
understand
her
.
It
suddenly
moved
,
walking
in
an
uncoordinated
and
jerking
movement
,
straight
towards
her
.
Nell
flinched
,
but
stood
her
ground
.
At
the
last
moment
,
it
veered
away
and
came
to
halt
by
a
vent
.
She
realised
that
the
creature
needed
heat
.
Doing
nothing
to
disturb
it
,
she
moved
deliberately
to
the
door
,
and
looked
through
the
spy
hole
.
There
was
nothing
to
see
,
only
wreckage
.
She
turned
back
,
and
only
then
remembered
that
someone
had
started
the
engines
.
If
it
had
been
Piphros
,
it
was
encouraging
.
"
Are
you
on
your
own
?
"
"
All
-
alone
.
"
The
tiny
child-like
squeak
sounded
wistful
and
sad
.
"
Why
did
they
all
go
away
?
"
Nell
probed
further
.
"
It
-
was
-
the
-
madness
.
"
Nell
shivered.
:
Having
said
it
like
that
,
even
though
she
had
suspected
it
all
along
,
brought
a
terrible
picture
to
the
mind
.
"
Do
you
know
why
the
madness
came
?
"
The
creature
avoided
her
question
.
"
I
-
was
-
often
-
here
.
They
-
called
-
me
-
Pip
.
"
Nell
digested
the
startling
fact
and
tried
to
come
to
terms
with
the
idea
of
this
creature
ever
being
a
ship
's
mascot
.
Then
she
relented
.
In
a
strange
way
,
if
you
forgot
what
it
really
was
,
perhaps
never
knew
,
here
was
a
kind
of
trusting
innocence
that
would
have
found
favour
with
the
non-scientific
crew
of
Titron
.
The
better
side
of
humanity
.
Piphros
seemed
unable
to
speak
for
long
,
needed
to
rest
its
chest
,
which
wheezed
and
bubbled
.
"
Madness
-
came
-
with
-
accident
.
"
Piphros
said
quite
suddenly
.
"
What
accident
?
Where
?
"
Perhaps
it
was
her
over-active
imagination
,
or
maybe
she
was
getting
used
to
that
strange
bland
face
and
the
enormous
overhanging
whale-like
brow
,
but
she
felt
she
saw
fear
flit
across
it
,
momentarily
.
"
Mahon

operation

wrong

"
Startled
,
Nell
remembered
the
operating
theatre
they
had
seen
.
She
could
only
guess
at
the
operation
.
Sickened
,
she
knew
that
they
were
more
likely
vivisections
of
human
tissue
,
experimental
procedures
with
the
toxic
chemical
and
biological
substances
carried
on
board
.
"
Who

"
Piphros
'
head
began
to
move
from
side
to
side

the
entire
body
shaking
,
and
oozing
moisture
.
The
creature
was
,
Nell
realised
,
terrified
and
sweating
.
Tears
rolled
out
of
the
eyes
.
"

"
Yes

Nell
swallowed
,
slowly
held
out
her
hand
,
forcing
herself
to
touch
the
obscene
body
before
her
,
instinctively
aware
that
a
gesture
of
contact
would
be
the
most
effective
way
to
calm
the
creature
.
The
skin
,
on
contact
,
was
surprisingly
cold
,
the
tissue
blubbery
,
like
a
hard
boiled
egg
.
"

Nell
flinched
as
the
whistly
words
came
faster
and
higher
,
as
Piphros
grew
more
agitated
.
"

Nell
still
did
not
know
the
details
,
doubted
now
if
anyone
would
.
But
it
did
n't
matter
.
The
essence
was
there
in
all
its
hideous
implication
.
Nerve
gas
tests
with
human
tissue
.
Embryological
distortions
.
And
God
alone
knew
what
other
sorts
of
mutations
and
genetical
mutilations
.
And
then
there
was
Mahon
,
and
some
disastrous
accident
that
had
spread
a
batch
of
nerve
gas
through
the
ship
before
it
could
be
dealt
with
,
leaving
Piphros
the
only
other
creature
alive
.
All
because
of
Mahon
.
And
Mahon
was
not
like
them
-
like
Piphros
.
What
grotesque
outlandish
possibility
was
it
that
made
Piphros
so
certain
,
so
frightened
about
it
?
Uneasily
,
Nell
realised
there
was
just
one
more
mystery
to
solve
on
Titron
.
And
it
promised
to
be
the
most
weird
-
was
definitely
the
most
lethal
.
A
great
bellow
of
triumph
exploded
on
top
of
them
.
From
right
beside
Lawton
something
huge
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
.
Lawton
screamed
,
was
lifted
off
his
feet
as
Delaney
swung
around
,
bomb
ready
.
"
Get
clear
!
For
God
's
sake
,
get
clear
!
"
His
beam
of
light
swept
wide
,
took
in
a
sight
that
was
fragmented
,
never
a
whole
picture
.
Then
he
was
knocked
flat
,
crashing
into
a
steel
wall
.
The
light
smashed
off
,
the
bomb
flying
from
his
outstretched
hands
into
the
darkness
.
But
Delaney
had
seen
a
glistening
,
moist
thing
wrapped
around
Lawton
's
waist
,
like
the
coil
of
a
snake
.
And
as
the
beam
of
light
had
spun
free
,
before
it
exploded
into
darkness
again
,
an
image
had
burnt
into
his
mind
that
he
would
never
forget
.
It
was
of
a
man
;
huge
,
encrusted
with
bony
protrusions
that
made
the
head
appear
square
,
as
though
he
was
wearing
a
helmet
.
And
with
a
flash
of
insight
Delaney
realised
that
was
what
it
was
-
or
had
been
:
the
headgear
of
one
of
the
deep
sea
diving
suits
.
But
now
it
was
welded
into
the
living
flesh
.
The
light
beam
had
swept
past
the
vizor
,
showing
only
a
black
,
featureless
hole
where
the
face
should
have
been
.
Delaney
landed
heavily
,
his
head
catching
the
corner
of
a
container
.
For
seconds
he
lay
stunned
,
conscious
only
of
distant
sounds
,
like
the
booming
of
heavy
surf
,
and
the
cries
and
screams
of
laughter
of
the
people
on
the
beach
;
except
the
cries
and
screaming
became
one
,
the
voice
of
Lawton
and
the
booming
surf
was
it
.
Suddenly
the
whole
of
his
existence
was
engulfed
in
an
inferno
of
blinding
blue
light
.
Lawton
died
in
agony
of
the
one
thing
he
had
been
so
afraid
of
;
died
in
an
agony
that
was
self-inflicted
.
Somehow
he
had
pulled
free
the
phosphorus
grenade
,
detonating
it
as
he
held
it
against
the
stinking
flesh
of
the
mercifully
unseen
horror
that
was
ripping
him
apart
.
He
knew
there
was
no
antidote
to
white
phosphorus
,
the
material
would
carry
on
burning
and
penetrating
the
vile
flesh
,
as
it
would
his
own
.
There
was
only
one
way
to
remove
it
.
With
a
bayonet
.
Still
half
concussed
,
Delaney
rolled
upright
and
staggered
.
The
sight
before
him
was
reminiscent
of
a
modernistic
painting
of
Hell
.
Burning
lumps
of
phosphorus
jelly
were
scattered
amongst
the
containers
,
forming
a
foreground
that
was
blinding
.
And
beyond
,
a
nightmare
creature
,
barely
perceived
in
the
swirling
dense
smoke
,
beating
at
the
flames
coming
from
its
own
body
.
In
a
second
it
was
gone
,
only
a
moving
glare
in
the
night
sky
beyond
the
roof
of
a
container
marking
its
progress
.
Delaney
saw
his
bomb
,
snatched
it
up
,
and
ran
.
He
paused
only
the
once
,
gazing
down
at
the
burnt
meat
that
had
been
his
friend
and
comrade
for
so
long
.
He
followed
the
flickering
light
and
the
acrid
smoke
that
drifted
back
,
marking
its
path
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
faked
like
the
bleeper
.
The
roaring
,
bellowing
growls
sometimes
gave
rise
to
screams
of
agony
.
The
moving
glare
stopped
.
He
could
hear
beating
noises
as
he
crept
closer
,
transferring
the
bomb
from
one
sweating
hand
to
the
other
.
Delaney
backed
up
to
the
container
,
began
edging
to
the
corner
.
The
flickering
light
was
fading
;
it
was
winning
its
battle
to
put
out
the
flames
.
He
had
to
do
it
now
,
while
it
was
still
illuminated
.
He
took
a
deep
breath
,
primed
the
fuse
,
and
leapt
around
the
corner
,
arm
raised
.
Its
back
was
to
him
,
flames
still
glowing
deep
in
its
side
.
He
ran
forward
,
scuttled
it
under-hand
between
the
massive
,
spread
legs
,
and
dived
away
to
the
right
,
rolling
and
rolling
,
arms
protecting
his
head
.
The
plastic
went
off
with
a
smack
of
solid
air
that
stabbed
pain
into
his
ears
and
moved
the
container
next
to
him
.
An
orange
ball
of
flame
ripped
up
into
the
sky
,
bathing
the
deck
in
light
like
a
miniature
sun
.
In
that
split
second
Delaney
saw
the
thing
in
its
centre
,
flung
like
a
whirling
gingerbread
man
right
over
a
container
.
Delaney
scrambled
to
his
feet
,
lurching
from
the
effects
of
shock
and
concussion
,
knowing
only
that
he
had
to
be
sure
;
had
to
see
it
dead
.
He
unwound
his
Uzi
,
readying
it
one-handed
as
he
used
the
other
to
support
himself
as
he
rounded
the
corner
.
He
could
still
make
out
the
huge
man-shape
,
lying
face
down
,
its
outline
glowing
from
the
residual
embers
of
the
phosphorus
,
like
a
blackened
,
smoking
tree
trunk
.
He
pointed
the
Uzi
,
pulled
the
trigger
,
Forster
's
words
coming
to
mind
:
"
Watch
out
for
this
one
,
John
.
It
's
not
natural
"
.
The
Uzi
jerked
in
his
hands
.
Six
hundred
rounds
a
minute
thumped
into
the
inert
body
.
There
was
no
spasmodic
jerking
,
nothing
but
the
angry
resurgence
of
the
phosphorus
embers
as
the
bullets
slammed
home
.
He
sprayed
it
all
over
,
hosing
the
stream
of
shells
back
and
forth
;
then
let
the
machine
gun
hang
loose
in
his
hand
.
The
job
was
done
.
He
slumped
down
on
to
his
haunches
,
let
his
body
catch
up
on
itself
.
Delaney
eyed
the
black
mound
with
its
tiny
glowing
stars
that
were
twinkling
and
gradually
dying
out
.
They
were
the
embers
of
Hell
itself
.
It
was
only
then
that
Nell
returned
once
more
to
dominate
his
thoughts
,
and
the
other
weird
creature
she
was
intent
upon
contacting
.
Suddenly
frightened
for
her
,
he
straightened
up
.
But
there
was
something
Forster
had
said
before
he
died
that
Delaney
had
to
check
out
first
.
Cautiously
he
approached
the
smouldering
heap
,
stood
over
it
,
and
wondered
if
he
could
nerve
himself
to
touch
it
in
order
to
turn
it
over
.
Settling
on
his
haunches
beside
the
back
of
the
grotesque
head
,
he
reached
out
a
hand
.
To
Nell
,
it
looked
as
though
she
would
never
find
out
the
last
mystery
of
Titron
.
Piphros
'
vocabulary
was
indeed
limited
and
was
unable
to
cope
with
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
things
she
had
asked
.
And
then
she
struck
lucky
.
"
How
is
Mahon
like
us
?
"
Piphros
waved
a
short
arm
to
indicate
itself
and
Nell
.
"
He
-
shape
-
of
-
man
.
But
-
he
-
part
-
from
-
the
-
sea
.
"
The
sea
?
She
remembered
the
research
submarine
at
the
bottom
of
Titron
.
Slowly
,
she
shook
her
head
,
and
spoke
deliberately
.
"
I
still
do
not
understand
.
"
The
strange
adult
foetus
before
her
grew
agitated
,
the
mouth
working
noiselessly
before
a
faint
sound
emitted
.
The
longish
sentences
were
delivered
robot
fashion
.
"
I
-
was
-
life
-
transmitted
-
on
-
ten
-
twelve
-
eighty
.
"
Now
fighting
for
breath
,
Nell
anxiously
noticed
that
Piphros
had
turned
an
unusual
colour
,
flushing
first
red
then
white
,
rhythmically
,
reminding
her
of
a
pumping
heart
and
vascular
system
of
some
small
translucent
creature
.
"
We
-
come
-
same
-
man
-
fluid
.
Only
-
I
-
am
-
normal
.
"
Nell
swallowed
down
the
revulsion
of
the
word
normal
.
She
guessed
that
what
was
being
said
was
that
Piphros
was
the
control
,
the
experiment
running
alongside
the
real
one
,
that
indicated
the
result
that
could
be
expected
with
a
known
norm
.
Momentarily
she
digested
the
horrible
implication
,
that
by
nineteen-eighty
the
work
on
Titron
had
reached
a
stage
where
an
enlarged
adult
human
foetus
had
presumably
already
been
tested
against
many
diseases
-
and
was
a
norm
.
She
shivered
.
Exhausted
,
Piphros
was
slumped
against
a
wall
,
mouth
working
,
the
while
wheezing
and
bubbling
as
air
was
being
sucked
in
.
Nell
waited
,
struggling
against
her
impatience
and
hunger
for
more
information
.
So
Mahon
was
mythology
made
real
.
A
true
monstrosity
.
A
genetically
constructed
freak
joining
humanity
to
-
what
?
What
was
there
in
the
sea
,
that
vast
untapped
resource
that
covered
nine-tenths
of
the
world
's
surface
,
that
could
be
worth
the
trouble
?
Some
other
intelligence
?
As
far
as
she
knew
porpoises
were
the
most
intelligent
.
Could
that
be
what
Mahon
was
?
A
cross
between
man
and
other
branches
of
mammals
,
that
lived
in
the
sea
?
What
little
she
knew
of
Mahon
did
n't
suggest
that
,
but
what
should
she
expect
when
genes
were
mutilated
by
chemical
or
neutron
bombardment
?
Surely
there
would
have
been
signs
of
porpoise
tanks
or
something
of
that
kind
on
board
,
and
there
was
only
the
diving
equipment
and
the
submersible
research
vehicle
.
Deep
.
Whatever
it
was
they
went
into
the
sea
for
,
it
was
found
way
down
in
its
ice-cold
black
depths
.
And
somehow
that
seemed
appropriate
.
Dolphins
were
happy
,
gregarious
surface
dwellers
.
Mahon
came
from
a
region
they
knew
so
little
about
.
Everything
about
Mahon
reflected
the
inhospitable
,
lonely
depths
.
Mahon
was
a
bleak
,
dangerous
hybrid
.
A
killer
.
Delaney
's
hand
was
on
the
verge
of
touching
the
blackened
,
grotesque
head
when
,
without
warning
,
the
scene
was
bathed
in
the
harsh
,
piercing
light
of
a
flare
.
He
hit
the
deck
,
moulding
himself
into
the
shadow
as
a
matter
of
conditioned
reflex
.
Even
as
he
did
so
six
glistening
,
shiny
black
figures
came
over
the
railing
,
rolling
and
flopping
on
to
the
deck
,
like
excited
seals
.
Only
they
were
men
,
scattering
,
seeking
cover
as
they
moved
towards
the
place
where
he
was
hiding
.
Delaney
watched
them
,
bemused
.
Why
had
Whitehall
sent
in
another
group
?
Were
they
not
going
to
destroy
them
after
all
?
A
surge
of
relief
-
for
himself
,
for
Nell
,
for
the
future
-
pushed
back
the
weariness
of
his
aching
body
.
Only
one
slight
query
remained
.
Why
had
n't
they
signalled
they
were
coming
in
?
He
had
n't
heard
the
aircraft
,
but
that
was
understandable
.
He
'd
been
rather
preoccupied
.
He
pushed
off
from
the
wall
,
stood
up
as
the
leader
,
pointing
at
one
of
his
men
,
issued
a
muffled
order
.
They
saw
him
at
the
same
time
as
he
realised
he
had
n't
understood
what
the
man
had
said
.
No
,
that
was
n't
right
.
He
'd
said
:
"
Left
flank
move
!
"
Only
not
in
English
.
Delaney
's
tired
brain
had
translated
automatically
,
as
it
had
been
trained
to
do
.
The
biting
,
characteristic
crack
of
the
AK47
's
sealed
it
.
He
dived
back
into
cover
as
the
bullets
whined
and
ricocheted
off
the
steel
around
him
.
There
had
n't
been
a
'plane
overhead
for
him
to
hear
.
Or
a
radio
contact
.
These
men
had
come
out
of
the
tubes
of
a
submarine
,
probably
a
Delta
class
.
A
Russian
submarine
.
He
pushed
a
fresh
round
into
the
Uzi
,
and
waited
.
The
flare
sank
lower
;
was
,
he
guessed
,
down
to
about
thirty
seconds
,
when
one
of
the
black
figures
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
.
He
took
careful
aim
,
steadying
the
Uzi
on
a
solid
surface
.
With
a
short
minimal
burst
he
dropped
the
figure
to
the
deck
.
Even
as
the
answering
hail
of
fire
swept
all
around
where
he
had
been
,
he
was
wriggling
away
on
his
stomach
into
an
alleyway
.
Then
he
ran
for
it
.
But
Delaney
was
under
no
illusion
.
Fate
,
it
seemed
,
was
determined
that
Nell
and
he
would
not
have
more
time
.
And
he
could
n't
bear
the
thought
of
her
being
left
alone
with
them
,
when
he
was
killed
.
The
flare
fell
away
to
the
port
side
,
and
went
into
the
sea
.
There
was
a
rustle
and
a
muffled
movement
.
Straining
to
see
,
he
caught
the
sound
of
the
pin
tinkling
to
the
floor
a
second
before
the
metal
object
struck
the
wall
of
the
container
where
he
'd
been
crouching
.
Almost
immediately
there
was
a
dull
thud
as
it
fell
on
the
floor
.
The
grenade
exploded
with
a
yellow
flash
of
light
that
revealed
a
line
of
three
of
them
already
up
on
their
feet
,
firing
from
the
hip
.
Delaney
took
out
the
nearest
,
then
rolled
away
and
sought
new
cover
.
But
there
was
hardly
any
left
,
only
the
long
empty
expanse
from
the
last
container
to
the
door
in
the
super-structure
that
led
down
to
Nell
.
And
as
if
they
knew
it
they
sent
another
flare
up
into
the
sky
,
so
that
it
glowed
bright
and
cheerful
as
a
street
lamp
above
his
path
of
retreat
.
Covering
fire
kept
his
head
down
as
somewhere
flankers
began
their
move
that
would
finally
pin
him
down
.
He
ejected
the
spent
cartridge
,
felt
in
his
ammo
pouch
.
There
was
only
one
left
.
Delaney
's
bomb
had
shaken
through
the
ship
,
vibrating
the
steel
like
a
tuning
fork
.
Piphros
gave
a
worried
squeak
,
eyes
widening
with
fear
.
"
Do
n't
worry
,
"
Nell
tried
to
reassure
.
"
That
's
good
.
It
means
our
people
are
attacking
Mahon
.
He
's
probably
dead
now
.
"
Dead
?
She
could
only
think
and
worry
for
John
.
But
the
explosion
seemed
a
good
sign
:
must
have
been
him
,
and
Lawton
's
and
Forster
's
doing
.
It
had
to
be
.
Dear
God
!
After
this
,
if
there
was
to
be
an
after
,
how
could
she
live
knowing
what
he
might
be
up
to
,
and
the
tight
corners
he
could
be
getting
into
.
Nell
felt
almost
giddy
at
the
way
her
outlook
on
the
future
had
so
dramatically
altered
.
She
'd
known
John
Delaney
for
about
six
months
,
but
the
last
few
hours
had
been
the
catalyst
.
She
dragged
her
thoughts
back
to
the
immediate
.
Piphros
had
given
her
all
the
information
possible
in
a
limited
way
.
What
she
wanted
was
to
get
into
the
laboratory
where
Piphros
had
been
life-commenced
.
She
shuddered
at
the
terminology
.
But
there
,
from
any
notes
,
she
felt
that
she
could
piece
together
what
had
taken
place
.
Nell
repeated
Piphros
'
life-commencement
d
ate
.
"
You
show
me
.
Show
me
where
.
"
The
great
cavernous
mouth
gaped
.
"
Not
-
safe
.
Not
-
safe
.
"
She
felt
guilty
,
especially
as
she
owed
Piphros
her
life
.
But
it
had
to
be
.
She
took
hold
of
the
ill-formed
,
chubby
hand
,
and
encouraged
with
a
hopeful
lie
.
"
Mahon
is
dead
.
Show
me
!
"
The
flare
fell
away
,
drifting
behind
the
funnel
.
Delaney
waited
,
wondering
from
which
direction
the
main
assault
would
come
.
An
AK47
cracked
again
,
keeping
him
down
low
,
and
blind
.
But
the
tracer
was
weaving
from
side
to
side
.
He
guessed
it
was
being
fired
from
the
hip
.
On
the
advance
.
He
was
conscious
of
the
rush
of
warm
fluid
down
on
to
his
lips
,
and
the
salty
taste
of
his
own
blood
.
Delaney
jerked
the
pin
from
a
grenade
,
tossed
it
blindly
in
the
direction
of
the
tracer
.
The
air
ripped
apart
,
a
dying
Russian
falling
like
a
rag
doll
on
to
the
ground
beside
him
.
That
was
close
,
he
thought
.
Too
close
.
He
popped
up
,
triggering
the
Uzi
as
soon
as
he
cleared
the
edge
of
cover
.
Two
more
were
coming
in
.
Delaney
turned
the
already
hosing
gun
on
to
the
nearest
.
The
man
jerked
upright
,
throwing
his
assault
rifle
away
before
collapsing
.
But
their
training
and
reflexes
were
good
.
Under
ordinary
circumstances
he
might
have
got
the
second
but
they
responded
to
his
aggression
with
speed
and
efficiency
,
bottling
him
up
again
with
a
hail
of
bullets
-
bullets
fired
from
very
close
range
.
The
game
was
almost
up
.
Piphros
stopped
again
,
chest
swelling
and
contracting
with
the
effort
.
Nell
looked
around
.
Funny
,
but
even
though
she
knew
Delaney
,
Lawton
and
Forster
were
engaging
Mahon
-
she
could
hear
gun
fire
-
the
empty
shadowy
corridors
of
the
place
gave
her
the
creeps
.
It
was
like
wandering
in
the
lair
of
giant
ants
-
or
something
.
Their
presence
lingered
on
;
or
at
least
Mahon
's
did
.
And
the
missing
army
of
workers
who
had
brought
him
to
life
.
Piphros
moved
again
,
walking
with
a
curious
,
and
uncoordinated
gait
.
They
turned
a
corner
,
and
Nell
understood
.
Should
have
guessed
where
they
were
headed
.
It
was
the
maximum
clear
zone
,
with
the
arrested
bomb
underneath
its
centre
,
and
Forster
's
ambush
point
at
the
entrance
.
As
they
approached
down
the
long
corridor
she
could
see
George
,
the
sacrificial
dummy
,
slumped
over
the
console
:
the
bait
for
Forster
's
trap
.
It
dawned
on
her
then
.
Forster
might
still
be
in
hiding
,
waiting
.
Leaving
only
Delaney
and
Lawton
involved
with
Mahon
.
Although
Piphros
was
in
the
lead
,
Nell
hurried
past
,
and
ran
into
the
room
towards
the
shower
curtain
.
"
Gene
,
"
she
called
,
"
it
's
OK
.
This
is
not
the
one
you
're
after
.
"
There
was
no
reply
.
She
pulled
the
curtain
aside
and
choked
with
the
shock
of
what
she
saw
.
Forster
was
laying
where
they
had
left
him
,
except
the
raw
area
of
his
face
had
turned
into
a
slimy
mess
.
Nell
backed
away
,
unable
to
cope
with
the
double
shock
of
Forster
's
corpse
and
the
foul-looking
thing
growing
on
him
.
She
stumbled
back
and
turned
into
the
reaching
arms
of
a
man-shaped
thing
that
was
coming
down
on
her
.
Screaming
,
Nell
and
the
bio-suit
Forster
had
dubbed
George
rolled
on
to
the
floor
,
locked
in
an
embrace
that
only
ended
when
Nell
hysterically
kicked
it
from
her
.
She
got
to
her
feet
as
Piphros
,
uttering
a
shrill
scream
,
retreated
out
of
the
door
.
"
Wait
.
"
Nell
rushed
to
Piphros
,
and
held
out
a
restraining
hand
.
"
We
're
safe
.
Mahon
has
gone
from
here
.
"
Reluctantly
,
Piphros
allowed
her
to
lead
the
way
past
the
suit
.
"
It
's
empty
,
"
she
said
.
"
Just
fell
on
me
,
that
's
all
.
Look
.
There
's
nobody
inside
.
"
Nell
pointed
at
the
black
empty
vizor
as
they
shuffled
past
the
sprawling
hulk
.
She
thanked
God
that
they
did
n't
have
to
use
the
shower
where
Forster
lay
.
There
was
another
one
.
They
disappeared
from
view
.
Some
twenty
seconds
elapsed
before
the
empty
suit
spasmed
,
then
one
leg
pulled
slowly
up
on
itself
,
as
if
an
inflating
pressure
was
at
work
.
Nell
continued
to
lead
.
There
was
a
master
over-ride
switch
outside
each
of
the
stages
,
allowing
them
to
pass
swiftly
through
until
they
were
at
the
deepest
level
.
She
stood
in
wonderment
,
looking
through
the
great
glass
observation
windows
into
the
centre
of
the
complex
.
Piphros
raised
an
arm
,
and
pointed
.
"
There
-
life
-
commenced
.
"
From
where
she
stood
,
working
access
to
the
most
inner
room
had
been
via
remote
control
arms
and
full-sized
plastic
window-suits
set
in
the
wall
with
their
own
flexi-corridors
that
stretched
out
behind
the
deeper
the
technician
moved
into
the
room
.
In
the
centre
of
the
laboratory
there
was
a
huge
bench
,
fully
equipped
under
powerful
lights
;
the
last
word
in
biological
barrier
working
.
Nell
turned
away
and
began
to
eagerly
search
the
mass
of
notes
,
manuals
and
graphs
stacked
on
desks
.
Piphros
nervously
kept
a
watchful
eye
back
along
the
way
they
had
come
.
Delaney
readied
himself
for
the
final
assault
.
Another
flare
had
just
burst
above
him
.
Now
was
the
time
.
Suddenly
a
black
figure
,
light
from
the
flare
gleaming
along
the
steel
in
his
hand
,
began
his
jump
from
the
roof
of
the
container
behind
him
.
Delaney
rolled
aside
,
and
pulled
the
trigger
.
Nothing
happened
.
The
figure
landed
like
a
cat
,
whirling
,
the
knife
hinging
at
Delaney
's
exposed
belly
.
He
caught
the
man
's
wrist
,
smashed
the
useless
Uzi
at
the
oval
streaked
face
set
in
the
black
rubber
cowl
.
The
Russian
twisted
it
out
of
his
grasp
as
they
rolled
over
and
over
,
locked
in
a
kicking
,
butting
embrace
.
They
crashed
to
a
halt
,
with
Delaney
underneath
.
The
man
increased
his
pressure
,
putting
all
his
weight
behind
the
knife
arm
.
The
tip
of
steel
began
to
inch
nearer
his
throat
.
The
only
sound
was
their
grunting
as
Delaney
willed
strength
into
his
arms
.
The
advancing
tip
slowed
,
trembled
,
and
stopped
.
Their
eyes
met
.
Each
was
aware
that
the
only
outcome
would
be
death
for
one
of
them
.
They
held
for
seconds
,
their
gasping
suddenly
drowned
by
heavy
machine
gun
fire
ending
with
a
scream
from
somewhere
close
by
.
The
Russian
's
strength
ebbed
away
.
Delaney
pushed
him
back
,
slowly
at
first
,
then
with
increasing
ease
,
carrying
on
as
he
rolled
over
the
top
.
The
firing
repeated
,
the
screaming
became
louder
and
nearer
.
Some
part
of
Delaney
's
brain
registered
confusion
.
Had
more
people
come
aboard
?
The
Russian
's
arm
collapsed
,
his
hand
hitting
the
deck
,
as
Delaney
smashed
it
again
and
again
,
feeling
the
bones
crackle
on
the
steel
.
The
knife
spun
free
.
Instantly
,
Delaney
drew
back
his
right
hand
,
stiffened
it
to
chop
down
as
his
left
hand
pulled
at
the
rubber
cowl
on
the
man
's
head
,
forcing
it
back
,
exposing
his
defenceless
windpipe
.
And
then
it
happened
.
A
great
bellow
of
inhuman
rage
froze
his
hand
in
mid
air
.
Nell
Anderson
's
eyebrows
furrowed
in
concentration
.
The
depths
they
had
dived
to
,
that
were
recorded
on
the
sheets
before
her
,
were
exceptional
.
And
always
to
areas
where
the
ocean
floor
dropped
dramatically
;
great
fissures
in
the
rocky
crust
.
From
them
they
had
taken
samples
of
mud
and
sediment
under
the
ledges
,
for
the
bacteria
.
The
names
designated
were
strange
and
totally
new
to
her
.
Then
as
she
scanned
yet
another
sheet
,
full
of
data
,
her
eyes
were
brought
to
a
halt
by
a
red
ball-point
circle
and
exclamation
marks
.
Sample
F/x-01–74482
.
Mahon
fault
.
The
word
Mahon
leapt
out
at
her
.
It
was
a
virus
.
Cross-references
led
her
to
a
file
containing
hundreds
of
individual
dossiers
.
She
took
the
first
one
and
began
to
skim
through
it
,
reading
the
cold
,
scientific
sentences
-
sentences
that
occasionally
broke
out
of
the
narrow
straight-jacket
of
accepted
reporting
,
unable
to
conceal
the
excitement
of
the
men
who
had
written
them
.
Virus
F/x-01–74482
,
soon
referred
to
as
,
simply
,
the
Mahon
virus
was
,
as
far
as
she
could
understand
,
a
unique
example
of
something
that
up
till
now
had
only
been
postulated
:
that
deep
in
the
ocean
,
under
the
terrific
pressure
and
in
temperatures
approaching
absolute
zero
,
there
had
remained
chains
of
biochemicals
,
primitive
viruses
that
had
been
part
of
the
great
"
organic
soup
"
at
the
creation
of
life
,
remaining
unchanged
as
the
rest
of
the
primordial
swamp
had
undergone
the
long
evolutionary
journey
to
form
all
the
complexities
of
life
on
earth
.
And
life
that
included
man
.
She
sat
back
,
visualising
the
scene
as
the
mud
in
the
sample
had
been
examined
by
remote
control
,
and
the
virus
isolated
.
It
would
have
been
handled
,
she
knew
,
with
all
the
caution
that
the
dust
from
the
moon
had
been
,
since
it
might
have
proven
to
be
toxic
as
any
of
the
man-made
monstrosities
aboard
Titron
.
Perhaps
a
plague
as
virulent
as
the
black
death
.
And
then
she
remembered
why
she
was
there
,
because
the
Mahon
virus
had
been
joined
with
humanity
,
had
been
introduced
into
the
genes
as
the
same
batch
of
fluid
that
had
given
life
to
Piphros
.
What
had
they
hoped
to
achieve
?
Why
all
the
concentration
on
genetic
engineering
?
Slowly
and
finally
it
dawned
on
her
.
Radiation
drastically
reduced
the
body
's
resistance
to
infection
.
But
viruses
were
extremely
resistant
;
they
were
incredibly
tough
,
and
able
to
withstand
great
extremes
.
If
only
man
could
be
made
to
-
She
felt
giddy
as
the
full
answer
came
,
crowding
into
her
mind
.
Using
the
cleanest
virus
in
the
world
,
least
changed
by
virtue
of
its
isolation
in
extreme
conditions
,
against
which
the
human
cell
would
have
had
no
natural
experience
,
they
had
inserted
the
Mahon
virus
into
the
molecular
structure
of
the
human
gamete
.
From
Titron
had
come
the
first
man
who
could
withstand
radiation
,
be
it
from
a
bomb
,
or
in
deep
space
.
Evolution
gone
one
stage
further
,
the
next
logical
step
of
the
most
intelligent
animal
on
earth
about
to
go
out
to
the
Universe
.
Self-induced
evolution
,
the
arrival
of
a
new
sub
species
-
Homo
Sapiens
Mahonis
.
Only
unlike
nature
they
'd
got
it
wrong
.
Terribly
wrong
.
The
Russian
,
on
the
point
of
death
,
seized
his
chance
as
Delaney
hesitated
,
reached
out
,
blocking
the
hand
chop
,
attacking
again
,
gouging
at
Delaney
's
eyes
.
Delaney
countered
,
smothering
the
Russian
's
arms
as
he
came
in
close
,
face
inches
from
the
man
's
as
he
yelled
in
Russian
.
"
Enough
!
Listen
!
"
As
he
said
it
the
bellowing
roar
came
again
,
right
on
top
of
them
,
and
a
long
drawn
out
scream
in
Russian
.
Delaney
's
opponent
ceased
struggling
,
looked
wildly
,
unbelievingly
,
at
him
as
they
drew
apart
.
Delaney
took
the
lead
,
carefully
raising
his
head
above
the
edge
of
their
cover
as
the
Russian
,
eyes
still
warily
on
him
,
followed
suit
.
The
sight
shocked
them
both
.
The
back
of
the
awesome
figure
caught
in
the
dying
rays
of
the
flare
was
holding
a
kicking
man
high
above
his
head
,
throwing
him
as
they
watched
over
the
side
and
into
the
sea
.
Another
crumpled
,
broken
body
lay
to
one
side
.
Delaney
could
see
the
huge
,
blistered
areas
where
the
white
phosphorus
had
burned
into
the
flesh
,
the
same
flesh
he
had
blown
and
burned
,
and
shot
to
death
less
than
five
minutes
before
.
With
an
angry
roar
the
creature
turned
,
its
masked
face
searching
.
At
that
moment
,
with
a
shower
of
sparks
as
it
hit
the
superstructure
,
the
flare
died
.
But
in
the
last
surge
of
light
he
'd
seen
beyond
the
reflection
of
the
glass
vizor
-
at
the
horror
within
.
At
the
face
.
It
was
angry
,
distorted
,
and
utterly
disjointed
.
A
parody
,
a
surrealistic
sculpture
in
green
slime
.
A
death
mask
of
pieces
badly
assembled
.
But
it
was
alive
.
It
was
real
.
Seeing
,
as
it
did
,
through
the
closed
eyes
,
as
it
looked
murderously
around
.
It
was
Silk
.
Mercifully
the
sparks
died
and
blackness
descended
,
leaving
the
huge
,
still
glowing
figure
outlined
against
the
lighter
backdrop
of
the
sea
.
The
Russian
swore
,
feverishly
searching
for
a
grenade
.
Still
stunned
,
Delaney
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
found
his
voice
.
"
No
good
.
Come
with
me
.
"
The
Russian
spoke
for
the
first
time
.
And
in
English
.
"
Why
should
I
trust
you
?
"
Delaney
scrambled
to
his
feet
.
He
had
to
get
to
Nell
.
The
shock
of
what
he
'd
just
seen
must
have
still
been
on
his
face
because
he
just
shrugged
and
ran
.
The
Russian
followed
,
shouting
as
they
neared
the
superstructure
door
.
"
Where
are
you
going
?
"
Delaney
stabbed
a
finger
downwards
.
"
I
have
one
of
my
team
left
.
A
doctor
.
I
'm
going
to
get
her
out
.
This
ship
is
going
to
be
blasted
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
creature
with
it
.
"
There
was
no
time
for
more
.
With
a
roar
,
it
began
to
come
their
way
,
searching
with
its
closed
dead
eyes
set
in
the
grotesque
moving
head
.
Delaney
reached
the
door
,
leapt
through
and
turned
,
shoulder
behind
it
as
the
Russian
joined
him
.
The
man
screamed
as
the
long
tapering
fingers
and
joints
of
a
gauntlet-hand
came
around
the
edge
,
like
the
claws
of
a
huge
crab
.
With
a
last
desperate
heave
the
steel
door
slammed
shut
,
slicing
off
the
row
of
fingers
like
falling
skittles
.
They
dropped
the
catch
as
the
door
quivered
under
an
enormous
blow
,
again
and
again
,
as
the
creature
screamed
its
rage
,
the
half-inch
steel
beginning
to
buckle
.
But
it
held
.
Relieved
,
they
backed
away
,
their
horrified
eyes
falling
to
where
the
amputated
fingers
wriggled
over
the
floor
.
They
just
ran
,
Delaney
leading
,
dropping
from
deck
to
deck
until
they
reached
the
engine
room
ladder
.
Delaney
pulled
up
,
frightened
at
the
sight
of
the
dismembered
barricade
at
the
bottom
,
but
began
shouting
for
her
as
he
dropped
down
.
"
Nell
!
"
He
kicked
the
wreckage
aside
,
and
ran
into
the
empty
engine
room
,
searching
,
as
the
Russian
looked
anxiously
back
up
the
stairway
,
listening
to
the
tremendous
blows
echoing
through
the
ship
.
There
was
one
last
terrific
crash
.
Then
silence
.
The
Russian
turned
to
face
Delaney
.
"
It
's
through
!
"
Delaney
tried
to
work
out
what
had
happened
.
Why
the
door
to
the
engine
room
was
open
and
undamaged
.
But
the
continuing
silence
was
ominous
.
That
the
creature
was
seeking
them
out
was
not
in
doubt
.
If
they
delayed
any
longer
they
'd
be
trapped
.
Delaney
tore
himself
away
,
going
back
up
the
stairway
that
was
the
only
way
out
,
and
back
in
the
direction
that
the
creature
was
coming
.
They
raced
up
the
steps
,
reaching
the
first
deck
,
wheeled
round
,
and
ran
down
the
corridor
.
Delaney
flung
open
the
door
.
With
a
blinding
roar
the
creature
reached
out
.
Delaney
slammed
the
steel
back
into
it
,
and
fled
,
with
the
Russian
ahead
of
him
,
diving
through
an
inspection
hatch
.
Delaney
flung
himself
under
a
deep
shelf
supporting
life
rafts
,
rolling
and
rolling
as
the
crab-like
hand
came
after
him
,
moving
sideways
,
just
missing
his
leg
.
The
fierce
,
distorted
blind
face
of
the
creature
appeared
at
ground
level
,
on
its
side
,
searching
.
When
it
found
him
the
mouth
opened
in
a
roar
of
triumph
,
lips
pulling
apart
behind
the
vizor
to
reveal
huge
yellow
teeth
.
Nell
feverishly
ripped
the
covers
off
three
of
the
files
,
hastily
stuffing
the
insides
into
one
of
her
empty
field-dressing
pouches
.
She
was
about
to
do
the
same
with
the
contents
of
another
file
when
something
made
her
pause
,
hair
prickling
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
She
looked
round
.
There
was
no
sign
of
Piphros
.
Nell
lowered
the
file
,
suddenly
frightened
,
and
still
not
knowing
what
it
was
that
had
disturbed
her
.
Then
it
came
again
.
A
slow
,
shuffling
noise
.
She
tried
to
call
out
,
but
her
voice
was
gone
,
frozen
in
her
paralysed
throat
.
The
shuffling
stopped
,
followed
by
a
long
silence
.
There
was
no
other
way
out
of
that
particular
area
except
through
that
door
,
and
Nell
edged
up
to
it
,
hesitating
at
the
sound
of
the
slithering
,
before
forcing
herself
to
turn
the
corner
.
What
she
saw
made
Doctor
Nell
Anderson
physically
weak
.
The
protection
suit
that
had
been
the
sacrificial
dummy
was
no
longer
that
.
Like
some
mummified
figure
it
was
bending
,
back
to
her
,
over
a
fallen
Piphros
.
A
black
living
slime
seemed
to
be
filling
its
interior
,
flowing
out
like
a
sticky
stream
on
to
Piphros
-
over
the
great
head
,
into
the
mouth
,
gill
slits
,
and
the
surgically-made
holes
of
the
ears
.
Piphros
'
one
big
eye
that
she
could
see
looked
at
her
reproachfully
before
it
was
entered
by
the
moving
,
living
tentacle
of
slime
.
Then
the
masked
head
moved
from
the
neck
of
Piphros
,
turned
slowly
to
look
at
her
.
Nell
clutched
at
her
chest
,
trying
to
stem
the
rising
swell
of
nausea
.
The
black
,
wet
face
pressed
to
the
glass
of
the
vizor
was
constantly
changing
with
the
movement
of
the
slime
.
And
it
looked
like
-
no
,
she
must
be
mistaken
-
like
Forster
.
As
she
watched
,
it
formed
itself
into
a
menacingly
parody
of
his
smile
.
The
mouth
slowly
opened
-
and
there
was
a
sound
like
a
hiss
.
But
there
was
no
mistaking
the
word
.
Nell
.
She
finally
found
her
voice
,
screaming
as
she
bolted
from
the
hideous
life-form
that
was
shaping
even
as
she
watched
into
the
form
,
the
outward
appearance
of
a
dead
human
.
And
a
friend
.
Her
fear
was
more
than
that
for
her
own
life
,
more
than
for
the
way
she
might
die
.
Her
fear
was
for
-
all
mankind
.
The
crab-like
hand
reached
him
,
closed
around
his
belt
,
and
began
to
drag
him
relentlessly
clear
.
Delaney
got
out
his
knife
,
struck
again
and
again
at
the
arm
,
watching
the
blade
plunge
into
the
surface
,
saw
it
ooze
and
close
over
again
.
He
realised
with
a
flash
of
almost
ludicrous
detachment
that
the
hand
that
was
trying
to
grasp
him
was
now
fully
formed
,
and
was
the
one
that
he
had
cut
the
fingers
off
when
slamming
the
steel
door
.
They
had
regenerated
with
incredible
speed
,
comparable
with
that
of
a
bacteria
colony
increasing
in
a
lab
dish
-
doubling
itself
within
hours
.
He
was
dragged
out
into
the
light
,
the
creature
's
awful
,
Silk-resembled
face
,
alive
with
the
movement
of
the
surface
slime
that
quickened
with
expectation
.
Its
other
hand
,
raised
above
him
,
preparing
to
strike
.
In
desperation
,
with
all
his
strength
,
Delaney
plunged
the
knife
straight
into
the
vizored
face
.
It
split
the
glass
,
entered
the
left
closed
eye
,
and
was
buried
right
up
to
the
hilt
.
Immediately
,
the
watching
Russian
jumped
out
,
spraying
a
fire
extinguisher
over
the
creature
's
head
.
It
let
go
of
Delaney
,
screaming
and
clawing
at
its
hooded
eyes
,
as
the
spray
added
layer
upon
layer
of
foam
.
Dazed
,
Delaney
shook
his
head
,
scrambled
to
his
feet
.
The
Russian
threw
the
canister
at
the
creature
,
pushed
Delaney
into
the
inspection
hatch
,
and
climbed
in
after
him
.
It
was
some
kind
of
air
duct
,
the
hot
,
dry
wind
pushing
into
their
faces
as
they
moved
away
from
the
murderous
thundering
noise
.
Something
filled
the
little
window
where
they
had
entered
,
occluded
the
light
coming
from
it
,
the
roar
carrying
up
the
vent
like
thunder
.
They
seemed
to
be
crawling
in
the
tunnel
for
a
lifetime
before
they
found
another
grille
.
Together
they
kicked
it
out
.
Cautiously
,
Delaney
stuck
his
head
through
.
The
corridor
ahead
was
deserted
.
He
pushed
out
his
shoulders
,
and
was
halfway
through
when
the
creature
turned
the
corner
,
coming
upon
him
with
terrifying
speed
.
The
Russian
pulled
Delaney
back
bodily
by
his
legs
,
helping
to
get
him
further
away
as
the
arm
with
its
vicious
,
razor-sharp
ends
,
flailed
wildly
through
the
aperture
.
Fifty
feet
in
they
stopped
,
utterly
exhausted
.
their
chests
heaving
.
In
the
semi-darkness
,
Delaney
could
just
make
out
the
Russian
's
face
.
He
sagged
back
against
the
wall
,
and
held
out
his
hand
.
The
Russian
hesitated
-
then
took
it
.
"
Thanks
.
My
name
's
John
Delaney
.
"
The
grip
was
firm
.
"
Gregor
Andrevitch
.
"
"
I
owe
you
,
"
Delaney
said
with
a
smile
.
The
Russian
shrugged
.
"
You
would
have
done
the
same
for
me
,
"
he
replied
.
It
was
funny
.
But
Delaney
knew
what
he
meant
.
Despite
the
fact
that
they
had
been
trying
to
kill
each
other
,
against
the
creature
they
were
united
.
Instinctively
,
they
were
men
first
,
enemies
second
.
"
What
is
it
?
"
Andrevitch
asked
.
Delaney
grinned
,
a
grim
,
humourless
smile
.
"
Some
sort
of
genetically
engineered
freak
.
Do
n't
you
know
what
it
was
that
you
came
for
?
"
The
Russian
shook
his
head
.
"
No
.
Did
you
?
"
Delaney
acknowledged
the
point
,
then
his
face
darkened
.
"
There
is
n't
all
that
much
time
.
Titron
is
doomed
.
My
people
ca
n't
afford
to
let
it
be
known
what
's
been
going
on
here
.
"
Andrevitch
frowned
.
"
You
mean
-
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
Delaney
finished
for
him
.
"
We
did
n't
know
it
,
but
we
"
re
expendable
.
just
a
holding
unit
.
"
The
Russian
stared
at
him
and
suddenly
understood
.
His
own
background
was
identical
.
Delaney
dragged
himself
along
the
tunnel
.
"
Come
on
,
"
he
urged
,
"
I
've
got
to
find
my
doctor
.
"
Nell
ran
wildly
,
careering
out
of
the
special
unit
down
the
corridor
,
charging
around
blindly
,
corner
after
corner
.
Finally
,
she
stumbled
,
fell
against
a
wall
,
clutching
it
for
support
and
sobbing
.
For
the
very
first
time
in
her
life
she
needed
someone
.
And
that
someone
was
John
Delaney
.
Gradually
she
got
control
of
herself
,
felt
her
heart
beat
slow
down
.
It
was
while
she
was
wiping
her
face
that
she
began
to
get
an
uncanny
feeling
that
she
was
being
watched
.
She
spun
around
,
searching
the
shadowy
dark
corridor
.
Two
of
the
overhead
lights
were
not
working
,
but
she
could
see
the
corridor
was
empty
.
She
looked
back
the
other
way
.
Nothing
.
There
was
a
faint
breathing
sound
,
long
drawn
out
,
with
a
faint
whistling
at
the
end
.
And
it
was
not
too
far
away
.
She
had
a
sudden
flash
of
memory
,
a
childhood
nightmare
after
seeing
a
horror
movie
where
the
cave
walls
had
suddenly
become
alive
with
rock
men
.
And
with
unnerving
certainty
she
knew
that
something
was
in
the
corridor
with
her
-
something
that
blended
its
colour
and
shape
so
perfectly
that
it
was
invisible
.
Trying
not
to
give
the
game
away
she
got
ready
to
run
,
listening
and
endeavouring
to
locate
the
direction
of
the
breathing
.
It
was
impossible
,
almost
like
trying
to
find
a
hedgehog
at
night
.
As
the
breathing
became
louder
,
she
saw
the
suspicion
of
a
shadow
-
a
vague
change
in
the
density
of
light
.
She
ran
for
her
life
,
never
seeing
the
figure
detach
itself
from
the
wall
,
as
she
did
in
that
far
off
childhood
nightmare
.
But
she
heard
Mahon
's
roar
.
She
ran
around
the
corner
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
John
Delaney
,
screaming
before
she
could
stop
herself
.
He
shoved
her
through
the
door
,
slammed
it
,
and
forced
her
down
towards
a
hole
in
the
wall
.
"
Get
in
the
vent
.
"
Another
man
took
her
arm
,
and
pulled
her
roughly
through
.
Delaney
pushed
himself
in
hard
behind
her
,
the
door
bursting
off
its
hinges
as
Mahon
lunged
at
his
disappearing
legs
,
slicking
off
a
chunk
of
rubber
heel
.
They
scrambled
away
to
the
background
noise
of
shrieks
of
impotent
rage
.
And
tearing
steel
.
Delaney
,
Nell
and
Andrevitch
lay
in
the
cramped
area
of
a
bifurcation
of
the
vent
,
dark
,
claustrophobic
,
sweating
-
but
safe
.
Nell
's
lamp
softly
illuminated
their
faces
as
they
held
a
council
of
war
.
Andrevitch
spoke
,
gesticulating
upwards
.
"
We
can
use
a
survival
raft
.
I
have
my
radio
.
My
people
will
pick
us
up
in
the
night
.
"
Grim-faced
,
Delaney
shook
his
head
.
"
It
was
never
intended
that
there
should
be
survivors
.
Whoever
finishes
Titron
will
scan
the
area
to
that
effect
.
"
His
eyes
found
Nell
's
in
ominous
silence
.
She
squeezed
his
arm
,
encouraged
for
his
sake
.
"
There
must
be
something
we
can
do
,
"
she
offered
.
Delaney
turned
to
Andrevitch
.
"
Your
submarine
.
Could
we
swim
out
,
underwater
,
to
it
?
"
The
Russian
shook
his
head
.
"
It
has
pulled
back
several
miles
.
It
will
only
come
closer
around
dawn
.
We
could
not
survive
that
long
.
"
Delaney
nodded
,
but
Nell
shook
his
arm
.
"
We
've
got
our
own
sub
.
We
could
use
that
as
an
escape
vehicle
.
"
Andrevitch
looked
puzzled
.
Delaney
was
sceptical
.
"
Have
you
any
idea
of
the
complexity
of
those
things
?
"
Nell
would
n't
be
put
off
.
"
It
's
worth
a
try
.
We
've
nothing
to
lose
.
"
Andrevitch
turned
to
Delaney
.
"
What
is
this
?
"
Delaney
told
the
Russian
about
the
submersible
in
the
bottom
of
Titron
.
"
You
forget
,
"
Andrevitch
said
,
his
eyes
gleaming
,
"
I
come
from
our
submarine
service
.
"
"
You
think
you
could
drive
it
?
"
Nell
asked
.
Andrevitch
shrugged
.
"
Let's
find
out
.
"
They
stayed
in
the
vent
,
moving
along
it
until
they
came
to
a
down
tunnel
.
The
torch
showed
that
it
was
some
twenty
feet
to
the
bottom
.
One
by
one
they
climbed
in
,
Delaney
first
,
Nell
in
the
middle
,
with
Andrevitch
bringing
up
the
rear
.
It
was
a
tight
,
suffocating
fit
.
And
pitch
black
.
The
torch
was
n't
on
.
Nell
pressed
her
arms
and
legs
outwards
,
slithering
down
in
short
movements
.
Delaney
reached
the
bottom
,
pulled
himself
away
,
then
guided
her
down
.
They
made
room
for
the
Russian
.
Nell
's
disembodied
voice
echoed
in
the
steel
tunnel
.
"
Which
way
?
"
Delaney
pulled
the
torch
from
his
pocket
.
"
My
side
,
"
he
said
.
"
We
go
as
far
down
and
as
near
to
midships
as
possible
.
"
He
switched
on
the
torch
-
and
froze
.
Two
yellow
eyes
were
inches
from
his
face
.
The
rat
was
giant
sized
.
It
leapt
forward
as
Delaney
cried
out
and
struck
it
a
glancing
blow
with
the
torch
.
The
snapping
jaws
missed
,
but
he
felt
its
far
as
it
swung
around
and
scampered
away
.
Delaney
wiped
his
mouth
.
"
Did
you
see
the
size
of
that
?
"
Nell
's
echoing
voice
reached
him
.
"
They
've
been
feeding
on
waste
from
the
labs
.
Full
of
hormones
.
"
They
descended
twice
more
,
then
they
could
find
no
further
down
turns
.
Delaney
stopped
by
a
grille
.
The
two
men
,
working
in
unison
,
kicked
out
the
panel
.
The
noise
seemed
to
reverberate
around
the
ship
.
Delaney
went
first
,
sweating
at
the
half-in
,
half-out
vulnerable
stage
.
Once
through
,
he
crouched
down
,
trying
to
get
his
bearings
.
Andrevitch
came
last
.
Delaney
helped
him
through
then
took
the
lead
.
Nell
noticed
slight
shadowy
changes
at
every
step
.
Found
her
teeth
were
clamped
so
tight
that
her
face
pained
.
She
kept
glancing
behind
them
.
The
corridor
remained
empty
,
as
far
as
she
could
tell
.
Delaney
reached
a
corner
,
and
paused
.
As
Nell
and
Andrevitch
waited
,
Delaney
edged
his
head
round
,
cautiously
.
It
all
looked
innocent
enough
.
The
lift
leading
down
to
the
diving
area
was
only
twenty
feet
away
.
He
waved
them
on
as
he
turned
the
corner
,
and
began
to
run
.
Then
something
stopped
him
.
He
slowed
,
became
wary
again
.
As
soon
as
he
thumbed
the
button
the
door
slid
open
.
Nell
half
expected
to
come
face
to
face
with
Mahon
inside
.
But
thankfully
the
interior
was
bare
.
Delaney
got
in
,
turned
,
hand
on
the
panel
as
Nell
followed
.
Andrevitch
surveyed
the
corridor
for
the
last
time
as
he
backed
in
.
With
a
hiss
,
the
double-sided
door
began
to
close
,
just
as
the
figure
of
Mahon
turned
the
corner
and
came
after
them
at
a
terrifying
speed
.
