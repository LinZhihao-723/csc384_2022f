Tom
O'Neill
came
through
the
revolving
doors
on
a
blast
of
icy
air
and
stepped
out
on
the
other
side
into
a
blanket
of
almost
oppressive
warmth
.
Outside
London
might
be
shivering
in
the
biting
cold
of
a
January
morning
,
here
in
the
foyer
of
the
British
and
Cosmopolitan
Insurance
building
centrally
heated
air
oozed
steadily
from
a
series
of
concealed
vents
to
waft
summer
warmth
into
every
corner
.
Tom
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
,
fished
in
the
pocket
of
the
dark
suit
which
he
scathingly
referred
to
as
his
"
city
uniform
"
for
his
identity
card
and
flashed
it
at
the
uniformed
security
man
.
He
did
not
like
wearing
suits
and
he
liked
a
collar
and
tie
even
less
.
He
was
far
more
at
home
in
jeans
and
a
sweater
or
the
favourite
scuffed
old
flying
jacket
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
,
who
had
been
a
Spitfire
pilot
in
the
war
and
he
wore
them
whenever
he
could
.
Occasionally
his
job
as
a
private
insurance
investigator
allowed
him
this
privilege
but
there
were
occasions
which
called
for
him
to
dress
more
formally
.
Visiting
the
Head
Office
of
one
of
the
companies
that
used
his
services
in
response
to
an
urgent
summons
was
one
of
them
.
Without
waiting
for
his
nod
and
wave
Tom
strode
past
the
security
man
to
the
block
of
six
lifts
beyond
him
.
One
had
just
arrived
at
ground
floor
level
;
Tom
followed
two
girl
clerks
into
it
and
pressed
the
button
for
the
fifteenth
floor
.
He
felt
rather
than
saw
the
two
girls
glance
at
him
appraisingly
but
took
no
notice
.
At
just
over
six
foot
,
with
thick
curling
brown
hair
and
eyes
that
owed
their
startling
blueness
to
his
Irish
ancestry
,
Tom
was
used
to
being
the
object
of
female
appreciation
whilst
being
slightly
puzzled
by
it
.
He
had
never
thought
the
reflection
which
looked
back
at
him
each
morning
from
the
shaving
mirror
was
particularly
handsome
.
His
nose
was
too
large
and
a
little
crooked
since
taking
a
devastating
straight
left
in
the
boxing
ring
when
he
was
fifteen
years
old
,
his
chin
too
irregular
.
But
women
certainly
seemed
to
like
it
and
that
of
course
had
its
compensations
.
Tom
had
not
reached
the
ripe
old
age
of
twenty-nine
without
discovering
quite
a
few
of
them
.
The
lift
halted
at
the
twelfth
floor
for
the
girls
to
get
out
,
then
whispered
on
towards
the
fifteenth
.
When
the
doors
opened
again
Tom
emerged
into
a
corridor
,
thickly
carpeted
in
grey
.
Like
the
twelfth
floor
,
glimpsed
through
the
lift
doors
when
the
girls
had
got
out
,
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
pale
lemon
wash
,
unlike
the
twelfth
they
were
hung
with
pictures
,
not
Old
Masters
but
not
Boots
the
chemists
either
-
prints
of
hunting
scenes
and
ships
and
a
beautiful
soft
sunset
over
a
bay
that
might
have
been
St
Ives
-
pictures
deemed
suitable
for
the
Executive
floor
of
a
great
international
company
.
Tom
passed
them
by
without
a
glance
,
heading
for
the
door
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
.
He
knocked
briskly
and
without
waiting
for
a
bidding
went
in
.
The
secretary
seated
behind
the
desk
in
the
outer
office
looked
up
accusingly
,
then
her
features
softened
and
a
faint
pink
flush
coloured
her
cheeks
.

nodded

Watching
him
disappear
into
the
inner
sanctum
,
Lucy
sighed
.
Why
was
it
the
gorgeous
ones
passed
through
so
fleetingly
while
others
,
like
that
paunchy

moist-palmed
Vic
Tatum
from
Marine
Claims
always
managed
to
delay
in
her
office
,
ogling
,
leering
and
making
suggestive
remarks
that
she
could
probably
take

a
Sexual
Harassment
Tribunal

Roger
Swansborough
half
rose
from
his
executive
chair
holding
out
his
hand
in
greeting
.
He
was
a
big
bluff
man
with
a
receding
hairline
and
aggressively
triple
chin
which
somehow
managed
to
make
him
look
powerful
but
not
fat
-
like
a
back
row
rugby
player
,
Tom
thought
.
He
had
already
removed
his
jacket
in
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
office
but
his
white
shirt
was
immaculate
and
as
he
reached
across
the
desk
Tom
caught
the
gleam
of
gold
cufflinks
against
the
stiff
white
cuffs
.
"
I
had
a
message
that

Tom
said
.

"
He
gesticulated
towards
the
expanse
of
glass
that
surrounded
the
office
on
two
sides
.
Beyond
it
the
sky
was
lowering
grey
,
shrouding
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
and
filtering
cold
dull
half-light
onto
the
streets
and
the
distant
river
.
From
up
here
on
the
fifteenth
floor
the
view
was
a
panoramic
one
-
unfortunately
this
morning
it
was
also
infinitely
depressing
.
Tom
did
as
he
was
bid
,
hanging
his
coat
on
the
heavy
carved
stand
behind
the
door
.

on

Roger

"
he
asked
smiling
wryly
-
his
job
had
made
him
cynical
.
The
older

grimaced

A
copy
of
the

paper
was
lying
on
his
tooled
leather
desk
top
;
he
pushed
it
across
to
Tom
,
stabbing
at
the
story
with
a
manicured
index
finger
.
"
You
remember
the
Martin
business
?
No
,
you
would
n't
,
of
course
.
It
happened
twenty
years
ago
,
when
you
were
still
in
short
trousers
.
A
luxury
cabin
cruiser
blew
up
off
the
coast
of
Italy
.
There
were
two
people
aboard
-
Greg
Martin
,
the
owner
,
a
financier
with
a
finger
in
more
pies
than
you
'd
care
to
name
,
and
a
woman
,
Paula
Varna
,
wife
of
Hugo
Varna
the
fashion
designer
.
The
boat
was
blown
to
glory
,
nothing
was
ever
found
of
it
except
for
a
few
bits
of
debris
,
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
both
occupants
were
blown
to
glory
with
it
.
"
"
British
and
Cosmopolitan
were
the
insurers
,
I
presume
.
"
"
Too
right
.
Not
only
the
boat
but
the
lives
of
both
Martin
and
Paula
Varna
-
not
peanut
policies
either
of
them
as
you
can
imagine
.
She
had
been
a
top
model
-
her
legs
alone
were
insured
for
a
five
figure
sum
and
he
had
enough
hanging
on
him
to
bankrupt
a
smaller
company
.
No
,
1970
was
not
a
good
year
for
British
and
Cosmopolitan
what
with
one
thing
and
the
other
.
But
that
's
our
business
,
taking
risks
,

it
works
well
enough

as
long

Tom
asked
.
He
was
trying
to
read
the
newspaper
upside
down
without
much
success
.
Roger
Swansborough
's
hand
balled
into
a
fist
and
he
brought
it
slamming
down
onto
the
desk
top
so
that
loose
paperclips
jumped
in
the
big
crystal

Michael
Trafford

with
an
Italian

He
was

Italian
himself

I
understand
his
name
was
Martino
originally
until
he
decided
to
drop
the
"

Americanise
it
to
Martin
.

he
was
an
American
citizen

in
the
States
as
far
as
I
can

Tom
reached
for
the
newspaper
,
turning
it
towards
him
.
He
scanned
the
print
,
seeing
that
it
echoed
more
or
less
exactly
the
story
Swansborough
had
just
told
him
,
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
photograph
alongside

three
people
,
obviously
dressed
for
leisure
.
A
thin-faced
man

balding

open
at
the
neck

gold
chains

a
woman

beautiful
in

of
the
quality
of
the
photograph
,
with
her
hair
tied
under
a
scarf
Princess
Grace
style
,
and
another
man
with
a
look
of
the
Mediterranean
about
him
whose
face
was
partially
obscured
by
sunglasses
.

Varna
insisted
not
at
the
time

his

had
been
in
need
of
a
holiday
and
he
had
been

away

Martin
was
a
close
friend

the
family

happy
for
her
to
go
with
him

you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions

was
English

tapped
the

protruded
from
it

The

gone

a

Fishermen
reported
hearing
the
explosion

bits

debris

washed
up
for
months
afterwards

There
appeared

there

plenty

both
Greg
Martin

it
all
as

see
when
you
look
at

Financier

woman

talented

it
was
heaven-sent
copy

for
the
more
sensational
press
.
And
she
was
a
mother
too
-
she
and
Varna
had
a
child

a
little
girl

was
about

out

the

In
a
corner
of
the
Salon
Imperial
of
the
Hotel
Intercontinental
,
Paris
,
Harriet
Varna
braced
her
back
against
a
statuesque
pillar
and
looked
steadily
into
the
viewfinder
of
her
camera
,
concentrating
on
her
subjects
so
fiercely
that
she
was
almost
oblivious
to
the
electric
atmosphere
that
surrounded
her
,
bouncing
off
the
Viennese
decor
and
the
sumptuous
rococo
ceiling
along
with
the
heat
and
the
light
as
the
models
of
the
House
of
Saint
Laurent
moved
gracefully
along
the
hundred
yards
of
catwalk
to
display
the
new
season
's
couture
collection
.
Only
the
constant
clicking
of
the
camera
shutters
of
the
army
of
photographers
and
the
intermittent
bursts
of
rapturous
applause
broke
the
expectant
hush
that
January
afternoon
,
for
Yves
Saint
Laurent
is
one
of
the
few
important
couturiers
to
show
in
the
old
manner
,
with
no
mood-setting
background
music
.
In
the
late
sixties
he
had
declared
"
Couture
is
dead
!
"
and
concentrated
instead
on
off-the-peg
designer
wear
,
but
twenty
years
later
his
revival
had
been
both
stunning
and
nostalgic
and
the
long-term
wealthy
and
the
nouveau
riche
had
come
flocking
,
craving
the
glamour
and
excitement
,
and
seeking
the
prestige
that
comes
from
owning
a
couture
gown
,
specially
,
individually
theirs
after
hours
of
masochistic
fittings
.
Now
they
sat
eagerly
on
the
rows
of
brittle
gilt
chairs
with
red
velvet
seats
,
their
exquisitely
made-up
faces
carefully
devoid
of
expression
as
they
made
brief
notes
on
their
programmes
,
pretending
not
to
notice
that
sometimes
the
clicking
cameras
were
directed
not
at
the
catwalk
models
,
all
of
whom
had
already
done
a
photo-call
session
for
the
photographers
the
previous
day
,
but
at
them
-
the
society
women
of
America
and
the
international
circuit
,
the
bored
charity
conscious
wives
of
big
businessmen
,
the
famed
actresses
of
stage
and
screen
,
even
the
occasional
European
princess
.
The
actresses
,
of
course
,
were
frequently
loaned
gowns
by
the
house
free
of
charge
for
the
publicity
that
would
be
gained
when
they
were
pictured
wearing
them
,
and
there
were
those
among
the
society
women
who
considered
themselves
above
coming
to
the
couture
,
ordering
instead
from
the
videos
that
nowadays
replaced
the
weeks
of
shows
of
the
old
days
-
and
staying
away
all
the
more
determinedly
as
the
great
Paris
houses
vied
with
one
another
to
tempt
them
to
lend
their
presence
to
the
occasion
.
But
there
were
plenty
of
beautiful
and
recognisable
faces
to
be
seen
amongst
the
anonymous
,
but
none-the-less
powerful
,
fashion
editors
,
still
enough
buying
power
in
this
room
alone
to
rock
empires
,
even
if
no
house
made
a
profit
from
the
couture
but
rather
used
it
for
a
loss-leading
advertisement
and
a
mark
of
prestige
.
It
was
at
none
of
these
that
Harriet
's
camera
was
trained
,
however
.
Instead
her
zoom
lens
was
pointed
at
the
rear
of
the
salon
where
the
apprentices
and
publicity
girls
stood
in
small
,
highly-strung
huddles
,
watching
the
gowns
they
had
worked
on
and
publicised
pass
by
on
the
catwalk
and
leading
the
explosions
of
rapturous
applause
.
There
was
one
girl
in
particular
who
interested
Harriet
,
a
small
girl
with
hair
cut
gamin
short
,
whose
face
was
so
expressive
that
it
seemed
to
reflect
every
one
of
the
emotions
that
they
were
all
feeling
,
these
midinettes
who
had
basted
hemlines
and
stitched
hooks
and
eyes
into
place
,
positioned
trimmings
and
sewed
them
into
place
with
such
tiny
stitches
that
they
were
all
but
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
.
Harriet
hardly
dared
blink
as
she
watched
her
through
the
viewfinder
,
terrified
she
might
miss
the
moment
she
was
waiting
for
.
Then
,
as
a
daring
but
romantic
gown
of
navy
blue
silk
crepe
made
its
appearance
,
the
moment
came
.
The
girl
's
face
came
alive
,
eyes
sparkling
,
hands
raised
to
her
parted
lips
in
an
expression
halfway
between
exultation
and
tears
of
joy
,
before
she
began
to
clap
furiously
.
Swiftly
Harriet
depressed
the
button
again
and
again
.
Perfect
-
perfect
!
That
was
what
she
had
been
waiting
for
,
that
unguarded
,
unforced
,
totally
natural
reaction
of
a
lowly
apprentice
who
sees
her
work
unfold
like
a
fairytale
.
In
a
world
where
so
much
was
staged
artificially
it
was
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
Harriet
experienced
her
very
own
glow
of
excitement
and
triumph
.
For
a
minute
or
two
longer
she
panned
the
camera
,
too
much
the
professional
to
allow
her
pleasure
to
make
her
risk
missing
another
good
shot
.
But
instinctively
she
knew
she
had
what
she
wanted
-
the
frames
that
would
lend
just
the
breadth
and
depth
she
needed
to
complete
her
picture
story
of
the
couture
shows
,
and
she
let
her
camera
fall
back
on
its
strap
around
her
neck
,
rubbing
her
aching
eyes
and
running
her
fingers
up
under
the
thick
fringe
of
dark
blonde
hair
that
barely
skimmed
them
.
Still
the
mannequins
were
appearing
,
their
elongated
clothes-horse
frames
moving
with
a
grace
which
belied
their
tight-drawn
nerves
,
still
the
bursts
of
applause
rang
out
to
drown
the
persistent
clicking
of
the
cameras
,
but
Harriet
leaned
back
against
her
pillar
almost
oblivious
to
them
.
The
clothes
,
beautiful
as
they
were
,
interested
her
not
at
all
.
She
had
grown
up
amongst
beautiful
clothes
,
been
dressed
from
childhood
in
designer
fashion
,
been
made
to
stand
still
for
fittings
for
her
graduation
dress
and
her
first
ball
gown
,
and
hated
every
moment
of
it
.
Clothes
were
all
very
well
,
they
were
her
father
's
life
and
she
knew
that
all
the
privileges
she
enjoyed
were
hers
because
of
clothes
and
the
stupendous
success
they
had
brought
him
,
but
she
could
n't
care
about
them
.
Except
when
they
made
wonderful
pictures
.
Pictures
were
what
mattered
.
And
in
her
camera
was
a
reel
of
beauties
.
Harriet
glanced
around
,
wondering
if
she
could
slip
out
unnoticed
.
It
was
heresy
,
of
course
,
but
the
show
was
likely
to
last
another
hour
at
least
-
Saint
Laurent
was
famous
for
the
length
of
his
shows
-
and
afterwards
there
was
bound
to
be
the
most
fearful
crush
.
Harriet
hesitated
,
then
her
natural
impatience
won
the
day
and
she
slipped
quietly
towards
the
exit
.
All
eyes
were
on
the
catwalk
and
no
one
appeared
to
notice
her
,
apart
from
a
tall
,
grey-haired
woman
in
the
uniform
of
an
atelier
who
moved
towards
her
accusingly
.
Instantly
Harriet
pressed
her
hand
across
her
mouth
in
a
theatrical
gesture
.
"
I
'm
not
feeling
well
"
,
she
whispered
in
somewhat
imperfect
French
,
and
the
woman
moved
hastily
out
of
her
way
.
Photographers
-
cochons
!
she
was
thinking
in
disgust
.
The
girl
had
probably
had
too
much
wine
to
drink
with
her
lunch
.
As
she
emerged
into
the
Rue
Castiglione
the
cold
hit
Harriet
like
a
slap
in
the
face
and
she
lifted
her
camera
,
easing
the
zipper
of
her
sky-blue
ski
jacket
right
up
under
her
chin
and
turning
the
collar
up
around
her
ears
.
Some
of
her
hair
caught
inside
it
and
she
flicked
it
out
,
a
careless
fall
of
dark
blonde
that
framed
her
even-featured
face
.
"
You
should
go
to
a
good
stylist
once

a
while

that
mane
tamed

"
Sally
,
her
father
's
wife
,
had
advised
her
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
but
Harriet
had
as
little
time
for
stylists
as
she
had
for
clothes
-
and
besides
,
she
rather
liked
her
hair
just
as
it
was
.
This
way
she
could
simply
wash
it
each
morning
and
let
it
dry
naturally
-
start
trying
for
styles
and
valuable
minutes
had
to
be
wasted
keeping
them
the
way
they
were
meant
to
be
.
I
must
find
a
telephone
,
Harriet
thought
,
as
she
hurried
,
head
bent
against
the
biting
wind
,
along
the
Paris
street
.
I
ca
n't
wait
to
tell
Nick
I
've
got
his
job

the
bag

I
'll

whether
to
post

last
reels
of
film
in
a
Jiffy
bag
or
fly
back
to
London
with
them
myself
.
The
thought
gave
her
another
fillip
of
excitement
-
her
first
job
for
Focus
Now
,
the
new
picture
magazine
Nick
was
editing
-
and
it
was
a
corker
,
she
knew
it
in
her
bones
.
Already
she
could
visualise
the
lay-out

'd

She
'd
nodded

She
'd
known
Nick
for
years
,
meeting
him
when
she
'd
come
to
London
to
visit
her
cousin
Mark
Bristow
,
Sally
's
son
.
She
had
just
started
out
on
her
career
as
a
free-lance
photographer
,
with
nothing
but
a
little
talent
,
a
lot
of
determination
and
the
best
camera
money
could
buy
to
help
her
make
it

had
been
a
sub-editor
in
those
days
,
working
for
a
huge
magazine
corporation

they
had
struck
up
an
instant
rapport
,
and
when
he
was
made
first
assistant
editor
and
then
editor
,
always
moving
from
magazine
to
magazine
,
he
had
pushed
work
her
way
whenever
he
could
.
They
had
even
had
an
on-off
affair
and
Harriet
suspected
he
was
in
love
with
her
.
But
she
could
n't
take
him
seriously

'd
echoed

his
soft
Scottish
burr
making
it
sound
almost
mournful

Harriet
had
experienced
a
moment

Nick
was
good
at
his
job

very
good

and
his
talent

hard
work
had
been
rewarded
when

decided
to
launch

Nick
had
landed
the
job
of
editor

when
he
had
told
Harriet
about
it
his
enthusiasm
had
been
infectious

slanted

tell
the
story
.
And
perhaps
with
a
social
angle
,
too

whatever
,
it
's
got
to

It

exciting

In
spite
of
her
apparent
self-confidence
,
in
spite
of
her
twenty-five
years
,
in
spite
of
having
had
the
best
that
money
could
buy
since
she
was
a
little
girl
,
there
was
an
ingenuousness
about
Harriet
which
sprung
from
a
yearning
need
to
prove
herself
-
to
her
father
,
to
her
contemporaries
,
to
the
whole
wide
world
.
Sometimes
being
born
with
every
apparent
advantage
in
life
spawns
the
deepest
need
to
create
something
just

oneself

Nick

seriously

"
You

it
's
a

But
start
with
Paris
.
After
all
,
to
most
people
Paris
is
still
the
centre
,
the
sun
around
which
all
the

satellites
revolve

the
rich
Kuwaiti

who
buy
merely
for
their

and
hide
their
couture
gowns
under
their
abayas
because
they
are
not
allowed
to
display
themselves
-
it
's
a
far
cry
from
the
fashion
world
as
it
is
usually
depicted
,
it
could
make
fascinating

Get
out

it

"
And
so
she
had
.
She
'd
done
the
photo
session
of
couture
gowns
as
well
,
of
course
,
clicking
away
dutifully
with
those
other
photographers
who
were
being
dictated
to
by
their
fashion
editors
.
But
it
was
the
unexpected
shots
that
would
provide
the
spice
to
the
story
-
like
the
ones
she
had
just
made
of
the
little
midinette
enthusing
as
she
saw
the
dress
she
'd
sweated
blood
for
,
if
not
created
,
come
down
the
catwalk
to
the
roar
of
applause
.
Harriet
pushed
back
the
cuff
of
her
ski
jacket
and
glanced
at
her
watch
-
the
clear
faced
leather-strapped
Patek
Philippe
man
's
watch
that
she
always
wore
in
preference
to
the
elegant
Cartier
her
father
had
given
her
,
unless
of
course
circumstances
forced
her
into
an
evening
gown
.
Perhaps
,
she
decided
,
she
would
go
back
to
her
hotel
and
phone
Nick
from
there
.
Then
she
'd
call
the
airport
,
enquire
about
flights
and
take
the
pictures
to
London
herself
.
She
'd
like
to
be
on
hand
the
moment
they
came
out
of
the
dark
room
.
And
it
would
be
nice
to
see
Nick
again
too
.
She
raised
her
hand
to
hail
a
cab
but
the
Paris
traffic
was
zooming
by
at
its
usual
break-neck
pace
.
Then
she
spotted
a
public
telephone
and
decided
she
could
not
wait
another
minute
to
call
Nick
and
tell
him
the
job
was
completed
.
She
dived
towards
it
,
anxious
some
other
would-be
caller
should
not
beat
her
to
it
and
begin
on
one
of
those
endless
conversations
the
French
seemed
to
have
,
searching
through
her
pockets
for
change
and
trying
to
recall
the
International
dialling
code
and
the
number
of
the
line
which
connected
direct
with
Nick
's
office
,
bypassing
the
busy
switchboard
,
all
at
the
same
time
.
"
You

Sally
had
said
to
her
once
;
Sally
,
so
cool
,
so
contained
,
so
efficient
she
sometimes
made
Harriet
feel
as
if
she
were
still
a
child
,
though
of
course
she
would
never
admit
it
.
At
the
second
attempt
she
made
the
connection
and
heard
the
telephone
begin
to
ring
at
the
other
end
.
Then
Nick
's
voice
,
that
soft
unmistakable
Scottish
burr
.

There
was
a
slight
awkward
pause
and
in
the
tiny
fraction
of
time
that
it
lasted
Harriet
experienced
a
stab
of
pique
.
Nick
was
usually
so
keen
to
see
her
she
had
to
fend
him
off
.
Now
,
just
when
she
was
bursting
to
talk
to
him
about
the
job
,
he
was
going
to
be
less
than
forthcoming
.
"

frowned

She
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
more
change
but
before
she
could
get
in
it
into
the
coin
slot
she
heard
the
click
.
"

she
said
urgently
but
it
was
too
late
.
The
line
was
dead
.
She
swore
,
banged
down
the
receiver
and
stood
staring
at
it
.
What
the
hell
had
he
meant
?
Should
she
try
and
get
him
back
again
or
buy
a
newspaper
first
and
try
to
find
out
what
in
the
world
he
had
been
talking
about
?
A
cloud
of
Gauloise
smoke
wafted
past
her
ear
and
she
became
aware
of
a
man
standing
behind
her
,
stamping
his
feet
as
he
waited
with
barely
concealed
impatience
for
the
telephone
.
His
presence
made
up
her
mind
for
her
and
she
turned
,
brushing
past
him
and
heading
towards
a
newspaper
vendor
who
sat
shivering
behind
his
stall
at
the
nearby
entrance
to
a
Metro
station
.
All
the
newspapers
on
the
front
of
the
stall
were
French
and
Harriet
cursed
herself
for
not
being
a
better
linguist
.
She
had
had
every
opportunity
to
be
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
but
she
'd
never
worked
hard
enough
at
it
and
now
she
did
not
feel
like
struggling
with
a
foreign
language
to
search
for
an
item
when
she
did
not
even
know
what
she
was
looking
for
.
But
tucked
away
at
the
back
of
the
stall
were
some
English
and
American
newspapers
.
Yesterday
's

No
,
praise
be
,
today
's

the
English
ones

anyway
.
She
pointed
to
one
and
pulled
out
her
remaining
change
to
pay
for
it
.
Then
she
retreated
into
the
entrance
to
the
Metro
out
of
the
biting
wind
and
opened
it
.
She
saw
the
story
at
once
.
The
photograph
seemed
to
leap
off
the
page
to
hit
her
.
Daddy
.
Mom

And
-
that
man

Unexpectedly
Harriet
began
to
tremble

She
inched
back
against
the
wall
,
part
of
her
wanting
to
find
some
private
place
,
yet
knowing
she
would
not
-
could
not
-
move
from
this
spot
until
she
had
read
what
the
paper
had
to
say
.
As
she
finished
her
breathing
was
ragged
,
her
eyes
darting
from
the
newsprint
to
stare
unseeingly
at
the
people
pushing
past
her
into
the
Metro
and
back
to
the
newsprint
again
.
In
the
street
the
traffic
still
roared
past
,
a
ceaseless
thunder
interspersed
with
the
honking
of
horns
,
but
she
was
no
longer
aware
of
it
.
Even
the
precious
spools
of
film
in
the
camera
slung
around
her
neck
and
tucked
into
the
pockets
of
her
jacket
were
forgotten
.
They
might
have
belonged
,
all
of
them
,
to
another
world
,
another
life
.
Greg
Martin
,
her
father
's
former
partner
,
was
alive
.
She
hardly
remembered
him
,
of
course
.
He
was
a
shadowy
figure
from
the
past
whose
name
was
scarcely
ever
mentioned
except
on
those
rare
occasions
when
they
spoke
of
the
accident
,
that
terrible
accident
that
had
claimed
the
lives
of
him
and
her
mother
when
Harriet
was
only
four
years
old
.
As
for
the
financial
crisis
they
had
gone
through
,
of
which
she
suspected
Greg
was
the
root
cause
,
that
was
never
spoken
of
at
all
.
The
whole
episode
had
been
so
horrendous
,
so
traumatic
,
that
her
father
had
chosen
to
wipe
the
board
clean
of
it
-
on
a
superficial
level
,
at
least
.
Harriet
pressed
a
hand
to
her
mouth
and
closed
her
eyes
.
The
street
seemed
to
be
full
of
perfume
now
,
wafting
around
her
in
the
biting
wind
-
the
perfume
that
was
the
most
evocative
memory
she
had
of
her
mother
,
a
haunting
perfume
,
light
and
teasing
and
sweet
,
a
perfume
that
smelled
a
little
like
a
summer
garden
at
dusk
,
a
perfume
,
the
memory
of
which
had
possessed
the
power
to
bring
tears
to
her
eyes
long
,
long
after
she
had
forgotten
how
to
conjure
up
the
image
of
her
mother
's
face
.
Mom
-
oh
,
Mom
-
why
did
you
go
away
?
She
had
cried
it
into
her
pillow
at
night
,
sobbing
with
the
vain
child
's
hope
that
tears
would
somehow
magically
make
it
all
come
right
,
that
in
the
morning
her
mother
would
be
there
.
But
of
course
she
never
was
.
Her
mother
had
died
in
an
explosion
on
a
luxury
yacht
,
they
had
explained
to
her
.
Gradually
she
had
come
to
terms
with
it
,
accepted
it
as
a
fact
of
life
,
though
the
grief
had
been
longer
in
going
and
the
sadness
was
still
sometimes
there
,
an
echo
in
the
night
.
But
now
-
If
Greg
Martin
was
alive
then
was
it
possible
-
was
there
the
chance
that
it
was
in
any
way
possible
that
her
mother
was
alive
too
?
The
enormity
of
it
rocked
her
.
For
long
minutes
she
stood
there
,
her
thoughts
not
so
much
running
circles
as
buffeting
chaotically
.
It
made
no
sense
-
none
-
yet
here
in
black
and
white
was
proof
that
nothing
was
the
way
it
had
seemed
.
For
the
first
time
in
years
Harriet
was
overwhelmed
by
a
wave
of
homesickness
,
and
not
now
for
New
York
,
but
for
the
haven
of
her
London
flat
,
the
bolt-hole
she
had
made
her
very
own
.
She
folded
the
newspaper
roughly
,
thrust
it
into
her
bag
and
walked
zombie-like
into
the
Metro
.
Get
home
as
quickly
as
possible
.
Suddenly
it
was
all
that
mattered
.
Get
home
.
Then
perhaps
she
could
think
things
through
and
decide
what
to
do
.
Sally
Varna
stepped
out
of
her
bath
,
reluctant
to
leave
the
froth
of
delicately
scented
bubbles
,
reached
for
one
of
the
enormous
pink
towels
the
maid
had
laid
out
ready
for
her
and
wrapped
herself
in
it
.
Then
she
padded
across
to
a
low
stool
and
sat
down
,
surveying
herself
in
the
mirror
that
lined
her
bathroom
walls
on
two
sides
.
The
face
that
looked
back
at
her
was
smooth
,
slightly
flushed
from
the
warmth
of
her
bath
,
certainly
not
a
face
that
looked
its
forty-six
years
.
Even
when
made
up
with
the
finest
cosmetics
money
could
buy
it
would
never
be
beautiful
,
but
still
-
not
bad
for
an
ugly
duckling
,
Sally
thought
,
smiling
wryly
.
She
lifted
one
hand
and
pushed
aside
the
fair
,
highlighted
hair
which
skimmed
her
ears
.
Yes
,
the
tiny
tucks
had
almost
gone
now
,
just
as
the
surgeon
had
promised
they
would
.
No-one
need
ever
know
she
had
had
the
facelift
if
she
chose
not
to
tell
them
.
That
was
why
it
was
so
sensible
to
have
it
done
early
,
before
the
little
lines
and
pouches
became
obvious
.
And
Sally
had
always
prided
herself
on
being
sensible
,
if
nothing
else
.
Sensible
Sally
.
Sally
"
the
sensible
one
"
.
That
was
how
she
had
been
known
as
a
child
when
people
had
contrasted
her
with
her
sister
Paula
.
"
Sally
is
very
clever
.
She
has
such
a
good
head
on
her
shoulders
,
"
they
had
said
,
when
what
they
really
meant
was
that
whilst
Paula
was
a
beauty
,
she
was
really
very
plain
but
they
had
to
find
something
good
to
say
about
her
.
They
had
meant
it
kindly
,
she
knew
,
but
it
had
hurt
all
the
same
.
She
had
n't
wanted
to
be
sensible
or
clever
.
She
had
wanted
to
be
beautiful
like
Paula
,
would
have
traded
everything
to
be
just
a
little
like
the
sister
whose
stunning
good
looks
had
the
power
to
attract
and
mesmerise
wherever
she
went
.
But
where
Paula
's
hair
had
shone
and
bounced
as
if
it
had
caught
some
of
the
morning
's
sunlight
her
own
was
straight
and
mouse
coloured
,
where
Paula
's
eyes
were
the
clearest
,
sharpest
green
hers
were
muddied
to
a
very
ordinary
shade
of
hazel
.
Her
features
were
similar
yet
somehow
blunted
,
her
body
stockier
-
not
fat
yet
somehow
altogether
larger
so
that
beside
Paula
she
always
felt
clumsy
in
spite
of
being
a
full
four
inches
shorter
and
almost
two
years
the
younger
.
"
Mummy
,
why
do
n't
I
look
like
Paula
?
"
she
had
asked
,
staring
wretchedly
at
her
five-year-old
reflection
in
the
mirror
,
but
her
mother
,
herself
slightly
bemused
by
the
young
beauty
she
had
produced
,
had
been
unable
to
give
her
any
satisfactory
answer
.
As
the
girls
had
grown
older
things
had
not
improved
.
No
matter
how
hard
she
tried
to
make
the
most
of
herself
Sally
had
always
been
aware
that
she
could
not
hope
to
rival
Paula
and
the
knowledge
had
damaged
her
self-confidence
so
that
she
always
lived
with
the
feeling
that
people
on
meeting
her
for
the
first
time
would
exclaim
behind
after
back
:
"
Paula
's
sister
?
That
plain
little
thing
?
Goodness
me
,
she
was
in
the
back
row
when
looks
were
handed
out
was
n't
she
!
"
The
fact
that
very
few
other
girls
she
knew
could
hold
a
candle
to
Paula
did
not
help
much
either
.
They
did
n't
have
to
live
with
this
goddess
,
they
did
n't
have
to
compete
with
the
legend
.
In
spite
of
this
,
Sally
had
adored
Paula
.
When
other
girls
,
jealous
of
her
looks
and
the
doors
they
opened
for
her
,
jealous
especially
of
the
way
the
boys
flocked
after
her
,
made
spiteful
remarks
,
Sally
had
always
been
her
fiercest
champion
.
No
one
had
wanted
to
believe
that
Paula
's
beauty
went
right
through
her
more
than
Sally
did
for
she
was
a
shining
golden
idol
as
well
as
a
sister
and
it
had
been
a
shock
to
Sally
when
she
had
at
last
been
forced
to
concede
,
in
private
at
least
,
that
the
other
girls
might
have
been
right
in
the
accusations
they
made
.
Sally
stood
up
,
letting
the
towel
drop
and
shrugging
on
a
silk
wrap
.
It
clung
slightly
to
her
still-damp
skin
and
again
she
surveyed
her
image
in
the
mirror
,
this
time
full-length
.
Years
of
dieting
and
exercise
had
banished
that
slight
stodginess
for
ever
;
now
her
body
looked
lithe
and
firm
,
yet
still
blessed
with
more
curves
than
Paula
's
had
ever
been
,
as
much
a
denial
of
her
years
as
her
face
.
In
some
ways
those
days
when
she
had
lived
in
Paula
's
shadow
seemed
a
very
long
time
ago
,
in
others
they
might
have
been
just
yesterday
.
She
had
never
been
able
to
equal
her
sister
's
matchless
beauty
,
she
knew
,
but
at
least
she
presented
the
world
with
a
fair
imitation
of
it
.
And
she
had
everything
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
-
more
.
This
house
on
Central
Park
South
,
a
ranch
in
Colorado
,
a
home
in
Montego
Bay
,
a
private
jet
at
her
disposal
,
the
wherewithal
to
buy
anything
which
took
her
fancy
.
Not
bad
for
a
girl
who
had
grown
up
on
a
council
estate
.
Most
important
of
all
,
she
was
married
to
the
man
who
had
been
Paula
's
husband
.
It
was
the
final
proof
that
perhaps
,
after
all
,
she
had
not
been
as
inferior
to
her
sister
as
she
had
imagined
.
Only
one
shadow
lay
over
Sally
's
life
,
a
secret
shadow
that
none
of
the
luxuries
she
enjoyed
could
quite
banish
.
For
a
moment
it
hovered
over
her
thoughts
then
,
with
an
ease
born
of
long
practice
,
she
pushed
it
away
and
went
into
her
dressing
room
.
Tonight
she
and
Hugo
were
dining
with
an
important
senator
who
generally
included
show
business
personalities
among
his
guests
and
she
had
not
yet
decided
what
to
wear
.
She
crossed
to
one
of
the
racks
which
lined
the
watered
silk
walls
,
her
feet
sinking
into
the
deep
cream
carpet
,
and
took
out
a
black
gown
,
holding
it
against
her
.
The
neck
was
high
and
round
,
the
sleeves
decorously
straight
to
the
wrists
.
But
at
the
back
the
bodice
was
slit
from
collar
to
midriff
and
the
skirt
was
daringly
short
.
Worn
with
her
Van
Cleef
diamond
earbobs
and
bracelet
it
would
look
quite
stunning
.
Yes
,
she
thought
she
would
wear
the
black
-
or
perhaps
the
strawberry
crushed
velvet
-
The
sound
of
someone
entering
her
bedroom
,
which
lay
beyond
the
dressing
room
,
made
Sally
turn
,
still
holding
the
dress
against
her
and
frowning
with
annoyance
.
She
had
instructed
the
maids
not
to
disturb
her
for
she
valued
her
privacy
and
having
staff
constantly
on
hand
was
one
of
the
things
she
had
found
most
difficult
to
become
accustomed
to
.
Very
nice
to
be
able
to
step
out
of
used
underwear
and
know
it
would
be
laundered
and
returned
to
its
drawer
pressed
and
scented
,
even
better
never
to
have
to
worry
about
clearing
a
table
or
washing
up
,
but
nevertheless
there
was
something
vaguely
disconcerting
about
maids
who
went
silently
,
sneakily
about
their
duties
under
her
very
nose
.
"
Who
is
it
?
"
she
called
a
little
sharply
.
The
door
to
the
dressing
room
opened
and
to
her
surprise
she
saw
that
it
was
Hugo
.
Her
eyebrows
,
which
she
darkened
artificially
so
that
they
no
longer
merged
into
her
skin
,
lifted
slightly
.
She
had
not
expected
him
home
for
at
least
another
hour
.
At
this
time
of
day
he
was
usually
still
at
his
office
in
the
550
building
on
Seventh
Avenue
.
"
Hugo
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
What
are
you
doing
home
so
early
?
"
He
came
into
the
dressing
room
and
closed
the
door
,
a
middle-aged
man
of
medium
height
wearing
a
grey
suit
with
a
white
roll-neck
shirt
.
Then
as
he
turned
towards
her
the
overhead
lights
that
she
had
switched
on
to
look
through
her
dresses
shone
directly
onto
his
face
and
she
noticed
how
pale
and
drawn
he
looked
,
lines
that
were
usually
unnoticeable
etched
between
nose
and
mouth
,
eyes
almost
feverishly
bright
.
"
Are
you
all
right
?
"
she
asked
.
"
You
're
not
ill
?
"
He
did
not
answer
,
just
stood
there
looking
at
her
as
if
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
how
to
begin
.
"
Hugo
!
"
She
took
an
anxious
step
towards
him
.
"
Greg
Martin
is
alive
,
"
he
said
.
His
words
stopped
her
in
her
tracks
.
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
"
Greg
Martin
is
alive
.
He
's
been
living
in
Australia
.
He
did
n't
die
on
the
Lorelei
.
The
whole
damned
thing
must
have
been
a
fake
.
"
"
Oh
my
God
,
"
Sally
said
.
"
I
know
.
I
could
n't
believe
it
either
.
But
I
've
had
the
story
checked
out
,
Sally
.
There
is
no
doubt
it
's
true
.
I
had
to
come
home
and
tell
you
immediately
.
Because
you
realise
what
it
means
,
do
n't
you
?
If
Greg
is
alive
then
the
chances
are
Paula

Oh
my
God
,

she
said
again
.
The
room
seemed
to
have
gone
dark
,
as
if
someone
had
turned
off
the
lights
,
and
she
wondered
if
she
might
be
going
to
faint
.
She
stood
frozen
,
still
clutching
the
black
dress
against
herself
,
looking
at
her
husband
and
seeing
only
her
world
crumbling
around
her
.
She
had
always
known
this
moment
would
come
one
day
.
Now
it
had
arrived
and
still
Sally
knew
she
was
no
more
prepared
for
it
than
she
had
ever
been
.
It
had
begun
to
snow
in
London
.
The
first
great
white
flakes
had
melted
on
the
pavements
,
now
it
was
falling
thicker
and
faster
,
building
up
on
the
window
ledges
and
in
the
cricks
and
crannies
,
turning
to
slush
on
the
roads
as
the
traffic
churned
through
it
.
In
her
small
workroom
on
the
top
floor
of
a
crumbling
old
warehouse
in
Whitechapel
Theresa
Arnold
shivered
and
turned
on
another
bar
of
her
portable
gas
fire
.
She
could
n't
really
afford
it
and
when
she
needed
a
new
cylinder
it
had
to
be
humped
up
three
flights
of
stairs
,
always
a
nuisance
for
which
she
had
to
enlist
the
help
of
one
of
her
boyfriends
,
but
when
she
got
cold
Theresa
's
fingers
turned
numb
,
white
,
bloodless
lumps
that
no
longer
seemed
to
belong
to
her
hands
.
Then
she
could
not
work
properly
and
it
was
imperative
she
worked
or
her
new
collection
would
never
be
ready
on
time
.
Theresa
rubbed
her
hands
together
to
bring
some
life
back
into
them
and
bent
over
the
sheets
of
paper
laid
out
on
her
work
table
,
trying
to
forget
the
cold
and
concentrate
on
her
designs
.
They
had
to
be
good
-
not
just
good
but
sensational
-
or
she
would
let
everyone
down
,
all
those
who
believed
in
her
-
her
small
workforce
of
pattern
cutters
and
outworkers
,
the
friends
from
art
school
who
dropped
in
to
lend
their
help
and
support
,
and
most
of
all
her
mother
,
who
had
put
her
house
up
as
collateral
for
the
bank
loan
that
had
set
her
up
and
enabled
her
to
get
started
.
Theresa
sighed
,
the
cold
depressing
her
and
quenching
her
usual
defiant
optimism
.
How
easy
it
had
all
seemed
then
-
how
exciting
!
When
she
had
graduated
from
the
School
of
Fashion
she
had
sold
her
entire
degree
collection
to
Lady
Jane
,
a
small
but
exclusive
West
End
boutique
,
who
had
greeted
her
designs
with
such
enthusiasm
that
she
had
believed
the
world
was
her
oyster
and
everything
was
about
to
happen
for
her
.
Riding
on
a
high
she
had
decided
to
set
herself
up
as
an
independent
designer
.
But
it
was
all
so
much
more
difficult
than
she
had
ever
imagined
it
would
be
.
Perhaps
,
she
thought
it
was
because
Mark
had
been
there
at
the
planning
stage
-
Mark
Bristow
,
the
dynamic
young
advertising
executive
she
had
met
and
fallen
in
love
with
when
she
had
been
chasing
jobs
in
the
heart
of
Somerset
;
Mark
who
,
in
spite
of
being
English
,
had
lived
long
enough
in
the
States
to
absorb
-
and
give
off
-
some
of
the
typically
American
blend
of
enthusiasm
and
energy
.
He
had
encouraged
and
praised
her
,
bullied
her
a
little
when
she
needed
bullying
,
and
given
her
the
love
and
support
that
had
made
her
feel
,
even
in
the
darkest
moments
of
self-doubt
,
that
she
could
rise
above
all
the
problems
and
emerge
triumphant
.
It
was
Mark
who
had
persuaded
her
to
approach
the
bank
for
a
loan
,
Mark
who
had
suggested
her
old
friend
Linda
George
,
who
had
graduated
in
business
studies
at
the
same
time
that
Theresa
had
finished
her
fashion
degree
,
should
join
forces
with
her
to
organise
the
commercial
side
,
Mark
who
had
given
her
enough
confidence
in
herself
for
her
to
allow
her
mother
to
put
up
her
house
as
security
-
something
Theresa
had
fought
against
even
whilst
realising
there
was
no
other
way
to
secure
the
loan
she
needed
.
And
above
all
it
was
Mark
who
had
made
her
feel
loved
and
special
.
"
I
am
very
proud
of
you
,
lady
"
,
he
had
said
and
she
had
glowed
with
happiness
and
a
secret
bubbling
excitement
that
came
from
believing
she
could
conquer
the
world
with
her
talent
.
But
now
Mark
was
no
longer
around
.
He
had
gone
out
of
her
life
suddenly
and
without
explanation
and
try
as
she
might
Theresa
simply
could
not
get
over
losing
him
.
Why
-
why
-
why
?
she
had
asked
herself
over
and
over
again
,
why
did
it
end
that
way
?
We
were
so
close
-
were
n't
we
?
We
were
in
love
-
were
n't
we
?
How
could
I
have
imagined
something
like
that
?
But
the
answers
never
made
sense
and
the
fact
remained
,
whatever
she
had
chosen
to
believe
Mark
had
simply
walked
out
on
her
and
not
bothered
to
come
back
.
She
had
begin
to
accept
it
now
,
but
there
was
still
a
yearning
deep
inside
her
,
his
absence
a
constant
nagging
ache
in
her
heart
,
and
her
business
enterprise
seemed
to
have
been
affected
too
,
for
it
was
as
though
some
of
her
confidence
had
drained
away
,
running
down
her
cheeks
with
her
tears
.
With
Mark
anything
had
seemed
possible
.
Without
him
some
of
the
magic
had
gone
from
her
life
and
the
dullness
encroached
into
her
work
,
no
matter
how
she
tried
to
compartmentalise
it
.
Now
the
problems
were
paramount
.
A
number
of
shops
and
boutiques
had
shown
an
interest
in
her
clothes
but
she
still
had
to
produce
them
,
innovative
yet
saleable
,
not
too
expensive
for
the
market
but
of
a
good
quality
.
In
many
ways
it
was
a
vicious
circle
-
everything
cost
so
much
more
if
one
could
n't
produce
in
bulk
,
but
to
produce
in
bulk
one
needed
capital
-
and
plenty
of
outlets
.
And
always
she
was
haunted
by
the
knowledge
that
if
she
failed
her
mother
would
lose
her
home
.
What
she
needed
desperately
,
of
course
,
was
a
backer
-
someone
to
put
up
enough
money
to
make
her
financially
secure
while
she
created
.
But
as
yet
no
genie
had
materialised
,
no
matter
how
hard
she
metaphorically
rubbed
the
magic
lamp
.
Linda
was
working
on
that
one
too
.
Let's
hope
she
comes
up
with
something
pretty
soon
,
Theresa
thought
.
If
she
does
n't
I
do
n't
know
how
much
longer
I
can
carry
on
.
The
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
rickety
staircase
leading
to
her
workroom
made
Theresa
look
up
from
her
drawings
,
a
small
ray
of
hope
that
refused
to
be
extinguished
flickering
to
life
.
Somehow
she
could
never
hear
disembodied
footsteps
on
the
stairs
without
wondering
fleetingly
if
it
might
be
Mark
returning
as
unexpectedly
as
he
had
left
.
Then
,
a
moment
later
the
hope
died
as
tall
young
man
dressed
in
an
aged
reefer
coat
and
brown
leather
cap
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
"
Weasel
!
Hi

"
she
said
,
smiling
a
greeting
which
she
hoped
concealed
her
disappointment
.
"

are
you

It

Harriet
stiffened

totally
taken
by
surprise

annoyed

to
be
an

some
kind

concerned

He
passed
it
to

she
examined
it
briefly
.
Somehow
she
had
no
real
doubts
as
to
whether
Mr

was
genuine

She
led
the
way
into
the
communal
hall

she
personally
had
taken
upon
herself
to
brighten
up
with
a
vase
of
dried
flowers

a
couple
of
good

ancient

rugs

she
had
picked
up
for
a
song
at
an
auction

the
full
light
she
was
surprised
to
see
he
was
much
younger

his
bulky

overcoat-clad
figure

was
not

would
apply

Tom
O'Neill

certainly
hunky

with
strong

a
full

lower
lip

She
turned
her
back
on
him
,
unlocking
the
inner
door
,
and
as
the
warmth
from
the
storage
heaters
wafted
out
to
greet
them
she
thanked
God
that
she
had
had
the
foresight
to
leave
them
on

she
did
n't

properly
warm

this

no

even

was
longing
for
a
drink

some
of
her
emergency
ration
of
scotch

she
did
not
see

she
could
have
one
herself
without
also
offering
one
to
her
visitor
,
something
she
had
no

doing

She
switched
on
the
lights
,
dumped
her
bag
on
the
table

turned
to
him
abruptly

jarred
Harriet

she
swallowed
at
the
ball
of
nerves

suddenly
seemed
to
be
constricting
her
throat

a
way

echoing

own
thoughts

hear
them

aloud

smiled

ever

Harriet
said
.
She
crossed
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
.
"

She
did
not
reply
,
simply
stood
holding
the
door
until
he
had
gone
.
Then
she
leaned
against
it
,
realising
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
still
wearing
her
ski
jacket
in
the
warm
flat
,
she
was
shivering
again
.
She
levered
herself
away
from
the
door
,
crossed
to
the
heavy
old
sideboard
and
took
out
the
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
glass
.
Taken
neat
the
spirit
burned
her
throat
and
she
held
the
glass
cupped
between
her
hands
,
staring
into
space
.
Was
it
possible
Paula
was
still
alive
-
and
did
she
even
want
her
to
be
?
Of
course
the
immediate
answer
was
"
Yes
!
Oh
yes
!
"
but
in
truth
it
was
not
that
simple
.
What
sort
of
woman
would
willingly
choose
to
leave
her
husband
and
child
without
a
qualm
,
allow
them
to
grieve
for
her
and
believe
her
dead
?
Certainly
not
the
dream
mother
a
bereaved
child
had
created
for
herself
.
With
a
sense
of
shock
Harriet
realised
that
in
the
last
hours
Paula
had
become
more
of
a
stranger
to
her
than
she
had
ever
been
during
the
twenty
years
she
had
believed
her
dead
.
A
beautiful
face
in
a
photograph
,
a
few
misty
memories
,
a
haunting
perfume
tugging
at
her
senses
,
and
Paula
had
been
whatever
Harriet
wanted
her
to
be
.
Now
for
the
first
time
she
was
face
to
face
with
fragmented
suggestions
of
reality
,
distorted
perhaps
,
like
the
sun
glancing
on
water
,
but
hinting
at
something
very
different
from
the
fairy
tale
princess
the
child
Harriet
had
claimed
as
her
own
.
Could
you
have
done
such
a
thing
,
Mom
?
Harriet
asked
silently
and
was
as
far
as
ever
from
an
answer
.
The
image
was
all
she
had
.
She
knew
nothing
of
the
real
woman
behind
it
.
The
long
hours
of
the
night
stretched
ahead
of
her
and
the
prospect
opened
a
well
of
loneliness
within
her
.
Despising
herself
for
her
weakness
she
reached
for
the
telephone
,
dialling
Nick
's
number
.
For
a
long
while
the
bell
rang
and
Harriet
felt
the
sense
of
loneliness
deepen
.
He
was
n't
there
.
Then
just
as
she
was
about
to
replace
the
receiver
she
heard
his
voice
,
that
soft
familiar
Scottish
burr
.

said

choky
suddenly

ask
me
,
Harriet

too
seldom

goodness
sake

she
said
,
looking
at
the
almost-empty
Scotch

In
the
time
it
took
Nick
to
arrive
Harriet
forced
herself
to
wash
and
change
into
a
clean
sweatshirt
,
though
the
most
mundane
of
everyday
actions
seemed
a
huge
effort
.
By
the
time
she
heard
his
car
squeezing
into
a
parking
space
outside
she
was
calmer
;
at
least
outwardly
,
opening
the
door
to
him
with
what
she
hoped
gave
the
appearance
of
nonchalance
.
"
Hi

He
kissed
her
briefly
on
the
lips
and
came
into
the
flat
,
a
slightly-built
sandy-haired
man
in
his
mid-thirties
wearing
a
heavy
black
overcoat
over
a
sweater
and
cords
.
From
one
of
the
voluminous
pockets
he
produced
a
bottle
of
Scotch
and
put
it
down
on
the
table

There
was
just
the
hint
of
a
question
in
his
tone
.
She
ignored
it

making
her
play
it
coolly
even
now
,
in
her
moment
of

the
slight
tremble
in

He
had
tossed
his
coat
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
was
pouring
whiskies
.
He
handed
one

looking
at
her
directly

She
gulped
at
the
whisky
,
then
thought
better
of
it
.

When
she
returned
from
the
kitchen
he
had
made
himself
comfortable
on
the
sofa
.
She
went
over
and
perched
herself
on
the
ottoman
at
his
feet

She
proceeded
to
relate
the
interview
,
keeping
nothing
back
apart
from
the
effect
it
had
had
on
her
,
but
Nick
knew
her
too
well
to
be
fooled

realise

off

reached
for
her

her
up

"
Yes

But
she
sounded
less
than
convinced
.
They
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
,
then
he
looked
meaningfully
at
the
whisky
bottle
.
"
Shall
I
have
another
drink
?
Or
am
I
going

She
laughed
shortly
but
it
came
out
as
a
half-sob
.
"
Oh

what
would
I
do

"

said
ruefully
.
"

manage
by

well

did
not
answer

"
Well

he
pressed
her
.
"
Do

have
that
other
drink
or
not
?
"
She
reached
for
the
bottle
and
half
filled
his
tumbler
.
"
Have
the
bloody
drink
,
Nick
.
And
please
-
I
would
like
you
to
stay
.
"
At
first
she
slept
,
heavy
,
exhausted
,
whisky-induced
sleep
.
Then
suddenly
she
was
wide
awake
,
nerves
jangling
again
,
thoughts
chaotic
.
She
eased
herself
out
of
Nick
's
embrace
and
he
did
not
stir
.
How
she
hated
sleeping
in
his
arms
!
Making
love
was
all
very
well
,
pleasant
and
soporific
if
not
exactly
ecstatic
,
but
afterwards
-
she
needed
her
space
.
I
'm
a
bitch
,
she
thought
sometimes
.
I
use
Nick
shamelessly
and
I
do
n't
like
myself
for
it
.
But
he
's
got
no
one
to
blame
but
himself
.
He
allows
me
to
do
it
.
If
I
were
a
man
I
'd
tell
me
to
get
lost
-
and
fast
!
Tonight
,
however
,
she
had
no
room
for
such
introspection
.
There
were
other
things
on
her
mind
.
She
eased
herself
out
from
under
the
duvet
,
reaching
for
her
heavy
wool
man
's
dressing
gown
and
tying
it
firmly
around
her
,
crossed
to
the
window
.
It
had
stopped
snowing
now
and
the
sky
was
clear
and
black
with
a
few
stars
.
Beneath
her
window
she
could
see
the
white
humps
of
the
pot
in
her
backyard
-
pots
that
in
summer
she
filled
with
geraniums
and
petunias
in
an
effort
to
bring
some
colour
to
the
uniform
greyness
,
beyond
them
the
wall
that
bordered
the
yard
was
also
white-crusted
.
A
familiar
scene
,
yet
one
that
had
changed
subtly
since
yesterday
-
just
as
everything
else
had
been
changed
by
that
newspaper
item
,
the
whole
of
her
life
being
undermined
making
her
feel
that
nothing
was
quite
as
it
had
seemed
.
In
one
way
,
of
course
,
Nick
had
been
quite
right
when
he
had
said
that
whatever
the
truth
it
made
no
difference
.
There
was
no
going
back
now
,
no
way
to
rewrite
the
years
as
she
had
known
them
.
And
they
had
been
good
years
.
With
a
child
's
resilience
she
had
quickly
adjusted
to
the
loss
of
her
mother
,
who
had
never
been
more
than
a
glamorous
appendage
on
the
periphery
of
her
world
,
and
Sally
had
stepped
in
to
fill
the
breach
more
than
adequately
.
Now
,
looking
back
with
the
wisdom
of
adulthood
,
she
could
appreciate
what
she
had
taken
for
granted
at
the
time
.
The
moment
the
news
had
broken
Sally
had
been
there
,
comforting
her
,
buffering
her
,
cuddling
her
when
she
cried
.
There
was
a
warmth
about
Sally
that
superseded
all
her
amusing
little
vanities
and
softened
the
acid
remarks
she
was
prone
to
making
-
which
were
in
reality
a
defence
mechanism
.
Sally
had
a
great
capacity
for
love
and
a
down-to-earth
quality
that
Harriet
presumed
was
a
throw-back
to
her
early
upbringing
and
which
had
been
honed
and
tested
in
the
fire
when
she
had
given
birth
to
-
and
kept
-
an
illegitimate
son
in
the
days
when
illegitimacy
was
still
a
scandal
.
To
Harriet
Sally
had
become
a
surrogate
mother
and
after
she
had
married
Hugo
that
position
had
been
strengthened
so
that
Harriet
had
felt
secure
and
loved
,
never
questioning
her
importance
to
the
people
who
were
important
to
her
.
Although
the
glamorous
world
of
fashion
and
wealth
spread
wide
around
her
,
Harriet
's
own
family
circle
was
tight
-
her
father
,
Sally
,
and
Sally
's
illegitimate
son
,
Mark
Bristow
.
Mark
had
been
educated
in
England
and
later
decided
to
live
there
,
and
it
had
been
because
of
him
that
Harriet
had
first
decided
to
come
to
London
,
though
nowadays
she
saw
little
of
him
.
He
was
in
advertising
;
he
and
his
partner
,
Toby
Rogers
,
had
their
own
agency
,
and
paradoxically
Mark
had
spent
most
of
the
last
year
back
in
the
States
.
He
was
there
now
,
setting
up
some
important
job
or
other
.
Had
he
not
been
she
might
have
telephoned
him
instead
of
Nick
,
when
she
had
been
desperate
for
company
.
But
then
again
,
she
might
not
.
In
a
way
Mark
was
too
close
to
home
,
too
much
a
part
of
the
world
whose
foundations
had
just
been
rocked
,
yet
somehow
on
the
outside
.
No
matter
what
the
truth
might
turn
out
to
be
it
would
not
affect
Mark
.
The
foundations
upon
which
his
life
were
built
were
intact
.
Winds
of
change
might
blow
around
him
but
his
basics
were
not
under
threat
.
Beneath
the
duvet
Nick
stirred
,
flinging
his
arms
across
the
empty
space
where
Harriet
should
have
been
.
She
stood
stock
still
,
hoping
he
would
drift
off
to
sleep
once
more
without
realising
she
was
not
there
.
But
after
a
moment
he
turned
over
again
,
mumbling
thickly
:
"
Harri
?
Where
are
you
?
"
"
I
'm
here
,
"
she
hissed
.
"
Go
back
to
sleep
.
"
"
What
are
you
doing
out
of
bed
?
You
'll
catch
your
death
.
"
"
No
I
wo
n't
.
"
His
concern
irritated
her
.
Was
n't
that
what
she
had
wanted
,
though
?
Someone
to
be
here
,
to
care
about
her
?
So
why
now
did
the
very
fact
that
he
was
awake
and
talking
to
her
seem
like
an
invasion
of
her
privacy
?
"
Come
back
to
bed
,
love
.
"
"
I
'm
all
right
.
"
"
No

're
bloody

She
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
he
was
thinking
not
so
much
of
the
next
photo
story
she
would
submit
to
him
as
the
necessary
therapy
it
might
provide
.
A
journey
into
the
past
,
with
skeletons
rattling
in
cupboards
at
every
dark
turning
,
was
almost
bound
to
be
upsetting
.
Nick
,
with
his
unfailing
journalist
's
instinct
,
felt
in
his
bones
that
this
one
would
be
more
traumatic
than
most
.
In
his
office
high
up
in
the
twenty-five
storey
building
that
is
550
Fashion
Avenue
,
mecca
of
the
New
York
fashion
industry
,
Hugo
Varna
sat
at
his
desk
and
fiddled
with
the
executive
toy
Sally
had
bought
for
him
last
Christmas
.
It
was
a
stupid
thing
,
he
thought
,
three
gold
baubles
on
springs
that
set
up
a
continual
motion
,
banging
one
against
the
other
,
and
he
kept
it
on
his
desk
only
to
please
her
.
But
today
with
his
mind
too
preoccupied
to
work
he
seemed
quite
unable
to
keep
his
hands
off
it
.
It
clicked
irritatingly
and
Hugo
pushed
it
aside
,
swivelling
his
chair
around
to
face
the
window
and
the
panoramic
view
of
Manhattan
.
Hugo
Varna
's
showrooms
occupied
an
entire
floor
of
the
550
building
and
from
the
moment
a
potential
client
stepped
out
of
the
brass
elevator
she
was
treated
to
an
ambience
of
unashamed
luxury
.
The
vast
foyer
was
carpeted
in
the
softest
green
imaginable
,
the
walls
were
even
paler
,
so
that
at
first
glance
they
might
have
been
taken
for
white
,
and
the
venetian
blinds
were
a
perfectly
blended
shade
of
moss
.
The
minimum
of
furniture
emphasised
the
impressive
size
of
the
foyer
-
only
small
modern
tables
bearing
huge
smoked
glass
ash
trays
,
two
or
three
low
chairs
and
a
huge
arrangement
of
dried
ferns
and
foliage
in
shades
of
brown
and
gold
graced
the
enormous
expanse
.
From
cunningly
concealed
speakers
piped
music
wafted
,
but
music
played
so
softly
that
it
was
almost
inaudible
to
the
human
ear
,
a
faint
teasing
melody
that
soothed
the
soul
and
created
a
restful
atmosphere
almost
without
one
being
aware
of
it
.
This
soft
green
womb
formed
an
oasis
of
peace
in
the
chaotic
tumble
that
was
Fashion
Avenue
.
Outside
in
the
street
the
traffic
might
roar
,
here
there
was
hush
broken
only
by
that
soft
subliminal
music
,
outside
the
air
might
be
heavy
with
the
mingled
smells
of
petrol
fumes
and
donuts
,
Macdonalds
'
burgers
,
trash
cans
,
and
sweat
,
here
there
was
just
the
faintest
perfume
of
a
pine
pot-pourri
,
subtle
as
the
music
.
Even
the
bustling
atmosphere
of
the
550
building
itself
seemed
not
to
have
invaded
the
Hugo
Varna
floor
.
Here
the
sales
staff
glided
about
with
languid
grace
more
reminiscent
of
Paris
than
New
York
,
the
house
models
managed
to
look
like
elegant
advertisements
for
Varna
even
after
a
long
session
of
standing
stock
still
while
a
toile
was
pinned
and
draped
and
adjusted
around
them
,
and
even
when
a
rail
of
sample
clothes
had
to
be
wheeled
across
the
hallowed
expanse
of
green
,
carefully
hidden
inside
grey
and
black
sample
bags
to
make
sure
they
were
safe
from
the
photographic
eye
of
a
fashion
spy
,
it
was
managed
with
what
Hugo
referred
to
as
"
panache
"
.
"
The
simplest
of
jobs
can
be
done
with
panache
"
,
he
would
instruct
whenever
one
of
his
staff
fell
short
of
his
standards
of
perfection
-
the
standards
that
endeared
him
to
his
"
Shiny
Set
"
customers
and
staff
alike
.
Hugo
himself
was
lithe
,
elegant
and
charming
with
a
slight
edge
of
fascinating
middle-European
foreignness
that
came
from
his
Bulgarian
father
.
But
it
was
his
own
formidable
talent
that
set
him
apart
.
Mostly
nowadays
Hugo
took
for
granted
all
the
assets
that
talent
had
brought
him
.
Twenty
years
at
the
pinnacle
of
his
profession
had
paid
him
handsomely
and
he
accepted
the
accolades
and
the
financial
rewards
as
no
more
than
his
due
.
But
on
occasions
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
to
wonder
just
what
he
was
doing
here
,
amidst
all
this
elegance
and
opulence
,
numbering
the
rich
and
famous
and
powerful
amongst
his
clients
-
and
his
friends
.
Not
bad
for
the
son
of
a
penniless
illegal
immigrant
,
he
thought
then
,
not
bad
for
a
boy
raised
on
the
wrong
side
of
town
.
"
Where
exactly
do
you
hail
from
,
Hugo
?
"
Margie
Llewellyn
,
the
chat-show
queen
,
had
asked
him
once
when
she
had
interviewed
him
,
and
he
had
mesmerised
her
millions
of
viewers
with
the
story
he
had
told
.
His
father
,
a
seaman
,
had
jumped
ship
to
seek
a
better
life
when
Bulgaria
had
been
on
the
brink
of
civil
war
in
the
1920s
.
He
had
taken
the
name
of
Varna
from
the
name
of
the
port
from
which
he
had
sailed
but
he
had
lived
his
life
in
terror
of
deportation
,
a
fear
that
had
haunted
him
long
after
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
real
threat
,
so
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
enjoy
his
son
's
success
,
seeing
it
only
as
something
which
drew
unwelcome
attention
to
the
Varna
family
.
Hugo
had
been
perfectly
happy
to
talk
at
length
on
the
Margie
Llewellyn
Show
about
the
days
when
he
had
played
on
the
streets
of
the
Bronx
,
and
how
in
this
unlikely
setting
a
talent
for
sketching
had
developed
into
an
interest
in
designing
clothes
.
Apart
from
his
father
,
Hugo
's
family
had
consisted
entirely
of
women
-
his
mother
,
his
three
sisters
,
his
maternal
grandmother
and
various
assorted
aunts
and
cousins
all
of
whom
(
his
mother
excepted
)
had
striven
to
dress
with
what
Hugo
would
later
call
"
panache
"
on
a
pittance
.
He
had
taken
far
more
interest
in
their
efforts
than
his
father
had
thought
was
right
and
proper
for
a
boy
and
when
Leonie
,
his
eldest
sister
,
had
been
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
his
fascination
had
grown
.
From
sketching
the
outfits
she
made
to
inventing
designs
of
his
own
was
but
a
short
step
and
by
the
time
he
left
High
School
he
knew
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
do
.
His
sisters
,
all
working
by
this
time
,
supported
him
through
a
course
at
the
New
York
Fashion
Institute
of
Technology
.
They
were
inordinately
proud
of
him
,
if
slightly
puzzled
by
their
unusually
talented
brother
.
When
he
graduated
Hugo
took
a
succession
of
low-paid
jobs
in
7th
Avenue
and
the
optimism
with
which
he
had
set
out
began
to
be
dimmed
by
the
sheer
sick-making
banality
of
what
he
had
to
do
-
cutting
samples
in
the
disgusting
fabrics
with
which
the
greedy
cutthroat
manufacturers
he
worked
for
made
their
living
.
But
all
the
while
he
was
learning
and
soon
the
time
had
come
when
he
was
no
longer
satisfied
to
design
for
others
.
He
began
cutting
his
own
samples
on
his
mother
's
kitchen
table
and
getting
them
made
up
by
his
sister
and
her
friends
at
the
dressmaker
's
where
she
worked
.
The
situation
could
not
last
,
of
course
.
One
day
Leonie
's
employer
had
got
wind
of
what
was
going
on
,
sacked
Leonie
and
placed
a
telephone
call
to
Victor
Nicholson
,
the
ignorant
,
ill-tempered
manufacturer
Hugo
was
contracted
to
at
the
time
.
A
distraught
Leonie
tried
unsuccessfully
to
contact
Hugo
to
warn
him
and
the
first
he
knew
of
the
debâcle
was
when
he
was
summoned
to
Nicholson
's
cramped
stale-tobacco
smelling
office
.
The
moment
he
walked
in
at
the
door
he
knew
something
was
very
wrong
.
Nicholson
,
who
could
often
be
found
reading
cartoon
comics
at
this
time
of
day
,
was
pacing
the
untidy
office
like
a
caged
lion
,
his
face
and
his
thick
neck
suffused
ugly
puce
above
the
none-too-white
collar
of
his
shirt
.
As
Hugo
entered
the
office
he
whirled
round
,
blundering
into
his
flimsy
chair
and
almost
overturning
it
.
"
What
the
hell
is
going
on
,
eh
,
you
little
runt
?
You
trying
to
ruin
me
,
is
that
it
?
"
Totally
taken
by
surprise
Hugo
could
only
stare
.
Nicholson
reached
across
the
desk
,
grabbing
Hugo
by
the
lapels
and
pulling
him
towards
him
.
"
Do
n't
stand
there
looking
like
Shirley
Bloody
Temple
.
You
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
.
You
've
been
cheating
me
,
you
stinking
ass
hole
,
letting
me
pay
you
for
second-rate
designs
while
you
market
the
best
ideas
yourself
.
"
Hugo
understood
then
.
He
began
to
shake
,
not
because
he
was
physically
afraid
of
Nicholson
,
though
the
man
was
twice
his
size
,
but
because
he
could
suddenly
see
his
world
falling
apart
around
him
.
He
'd
taken
a
chance
and
he
'd
been
found
out
.
"
I
suppose
this
means
you
want
me
to
leave
,
"
he
said
with
what
dignity
he
could
,
half-sprawled
across
the
desk
with
his
chin
six
inches
above
the
remains
of
a
take-away
pizza
and
a
cardboard
cup
of
coffee
dregs
.
"
Too
right
it
does
.
And
that
's
not
all
.
"
Nicholson
released
him
,
pushing
him
back
so
hard
he
almost
fell
.
"
Now
hear
this
and
hear
it
good
.
I
'm
suing
you
,
Varna
,
for
every
cent
you
've
made
from
your
dirty
little
deals

and

the
designs
.
They
belong
to
me
-
you
're
under
contract
,
do
n't
forget
.
"
Hugo
snorted
derisively
.
Although
the
very
thought
of
court
action
had
brought
him
out
in
a
cold
sweat
,
the
same
grittiness
which
had
enabled
his
father
to
jump
ship
and
seek
a
new
life
now
came
to
his
rescue
.
"
Waste
your
money
on
lawyers
if
that
's
the
way
you
want
it

"

"
Nicholson
had
turned
such
a
deep
shade
of
purple
Hugo
thought
he
was
about
to
suffer
a
stroke
.
"
Get
out
of
here
!
"
he
yelled
.
"
I
do
n't
want
to
see
your
ass
around
here
again
-
understand
?
Get
out
!
"
Hugo
had
got
out
.
He
had
left
the
squalid
little
office
that
afternoon
never
to
return
.
It
was
the
most
important
thing
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
,
he
had
told
Margie
Llewellyn
,
and
across
a
nation
the
rich
and
famous
,
the
elegant
and
the
glittering
society
women
who
were
his
clients
wholeheartedly
echoed
the
sentiment
.
Nicholson
had
never
carried
out
his
threat
to
sue
,
though
Hugo
had
endured
some
worrying
weeks
waiting
to
see
if
papers
would
be
served
on
him
,
and
the
experience
had
made
him
determined
never
to
work
for
the
likes
of
Nicholson
again
.
His
early
ventures
into
freelance
design
had
been
reasonably
successful
;
with
Leonie
's
encouragement
he
worked
long
hours
as
a
restaurant
porter
to
earn
enough
money
to
buy
a
couple
of
ancient
industrial
machines
which
he
set
up
at
one
end
of
the
living
room
of
his
mother
's
house
.
Soon
the
place
was
alive
with
their
busy
whirr
as
Leonie
and
one
of
her
friends
stitched
samples
;
to
their
accompaniment
Hugo
worked
on
new
designs
.
The
story
of
this
far
from
illustrious
beginning
was
one
Hugo
never
tired
of
telling
,
for
the
fact
that
he
had
started
with
nothing
but
raw
talent
and
stubborn
determination
was
something
of
which
he
was
justifiably
proud
but
he
was
less
forthcoming
about
what
had
happened
next
.
When
Margie
had
mentioned
his
association
with
Greg
Martin
,
the
financier
who
had
made
him
the
loan
which
had
set
him
up
in
a
small
showroom
and
enabled
him
to
move
the
sewing
machines
out
of
the
living
room
and
into
a
work
room
,
Hugo
became
not
so
much
evasive
as
totally
silent
.
Without
a
doubt
it
had
been
Greg
's
backing
which
had
propelled
him
into
the
big
league
;
without
him
,
for
all
his
talent
,
Hugo
might
have
been
trapped
in
small-time
design
and
manufacture
for
ever
.
But
the
very
mention
of
Greg
Martin
's
name
was
painful
to
Hugo
.
He
had
skilfully
evaded
Margie
's
questions
,
moving
on
to
talk
instead
about
Kurt
Eklund
,
the
financial
genius
he
had
hired
after
Greg
's
death
to
help
him
avoid
what
had
seemed
at
the
time
almost
certain
ruin
.
It
had
been
Kurt
who
had
set
up
the
dozens
of
licensing
deals
for
menswear
and
toiletries
,
bedlinen
and
beachwear
,
soft
furnishings
and
costume
jewellery
,
all
bearing
the
name
of
Hugo
Varna
,
which
had
not
only
saved
him
from
bankruptcy
but
also
made
him
his
first
million
.
In
the
process
Kurt
had
graduated
from
business
adviser
to
trusted
friend
;
Hugo
had
rewarded
him
with
a
fifteen
per
cent
share
of
the
business
and
never
regretted
it
.
Margie
had
not
pressed
Hugo
to
talk
about
Greg
Martin
though
her
professional
instincts
had
nagged
at
her
that
if
she
could
probe
a
little
into
the
association
it
would
produce
some
riveting
television
.
But
she
also
sensed
how
deep
Hugo
's
hurt
ran
and
since
his
first
wife
's
death
was
also
connected
with
the
man
she
told
herself
it
would
be
tasteless
to
dwell
on
it
.
The
truth
was
,
of
course
,
that
hard-nosed
journalist
though
she
was
,
Margie
was
as
attracted
to
Hugo
as
was
almost
every
other
woman
who
met
him
and
she
actually
wanted
him
to
like
her
.
The
momentary
weakness
had
bothered
her
for
weeks
afterwards
as
she
worried
as
to
whether
she
had
lost
her
professionalism
along
with
the
opportunity
to
grill
Hugo
Varna
over
the
truth
about
his
relationship
-
and
Paula
's
-
with
the
man
who
had
died
as
he
lived
in
a
blaze
of
publicity
.
But
whether
she
had
been
right
or
wrong
,
Hugo
had
been
allowed
off
the
hook
.
He
did
not
talk
about
Greg
Martin
.
He
did
not
even
think
about
Greg
Martin
if
he
could
help
it
.
As
he
left
the
studio
after
the
interview
his
well-programmed
defence
mechanism
had
come
into
operation
,
and
he
had
pushed
the
painful
memories
into
a
corner
of
his
brain
where
his
conscious
mind
could
not
reach
them
.
Now
,
however
,
to
his
intense
discomfort
,
Hugo
found
there
was
no
way
he
could
prevent
himself
from
thinking
about
Greg
Martin
.
From
the
moment
the
news
had
broken
that
he
was
not
dead
at
all
but
very
much
alive
in
Australia
he
had
been
unable
to
think
of
anything
else
.
None
of
the
usual
tricks
for
shutting
off
memory
would
work
now
;
whatever
he
did
,
whichever
way
he
diverted
his
attention
it
would
only
come
wandering
back
,
like
a
man
in
a
maze
who
continually
finds
himself
back
in
the
same
spot
.
It
was
insufferable
-
awful
.
He
was
beginning
to
think
he
was
going
mad
.
His
nerves
jangled
in
time
with
the
balls
on
the
executive
toy
on
his
desk
and
his
brain
felt
as
thick
and
muzzy
as
the
grey
January
sky
above
the
skyscrapers
of
Manhattan
.
A
slight
commotion
in
the
outer
office
attracted
his
attention
.
His
secretary
's
voice
,
raised
in
agitation
:
"
I
'm
sorry
-
Mr
Varna
is
not
to
be
disturbed
.
You
ca
n't
go
in

"
And
another
voice
,
one
he
instantly
recognised
:
"
Like
hell
I
ca
n't
!
"
The
door
flew
open
and
Harriet
burst
in
.
Behind
her
the
secretary
floundered
helplessly
.
"

'm
sorry

Varna

could
n't
stop

"
"

Varna

"
she
stuttered
,
even
more
horrified
by
her
gaffe
than
she
had
been
about
letting
a
strange
woman
push
her
way
into
the
holy
of
holies
.
Nancy
Ball
had
only
been
with
Hugo
for
a
few
months
and
it
was
much
longer
than
that
since
Harriet
had
visited
him
at
the
office
.
It
had
simply
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
young
woman
in
a
ski
jacket
with
faded
jeans
tucked
into
her
boots
might
actually
be
Hugo
Varna
's
daughter
!
"
Do
n't
worry
about
it
,
Nancy
,
"
he
said
comfortingly
.
"
You

n't
to
know

"
She
retreated
,
casting
one
last
flustered
glance
at
Harriet
.
Sally
,
Hugo
's
wife
,
was
always
so
beautifully
turned
out
,
while
this
girl
was
-
well
,
frankly
almost
scruffy
!
Women
simply
never
turned
up
at
the
showrooms
of
one
of
America
's
top
designers
dressed
like
that
,
and
with
practically
no
make-up

in
New

to
unravel

His
eyes
darkened
at

"
For
a

we

down
because

it

He
rescued
me

a

it

thank
God
he
did

as
for
Greg

I
suppose
you
could
say
I
was
all
kinds
of
a
fool
to
trust
him

but
I
'm
a
designer

I
was
n't
the
only
one
taken
in

him

far
from
it

were
plenty
of
others
with
more
experience
in
these
matters

I
who
were
deceived

Oh
yes

if
Greg
had
been
around
when
the
storm
broke
he
'd
have
faced
ruin

probably
gone
to
gaol
into
the
bargain

No
doubt

it

made
a
very
timely

way

the
other

"
Harriet
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
chewing
on
her
thumbnail
.
So
-
Greg
had
been
little
better
than
a
crook
on
the
business
front
-
and
he
had
very
nearly
dragged
her
father

suspected

much

never
occurred

her

been
anything

an
accident

important
as
all
this
might

been
it
did
not
concern
her

Hugo

weathered
that
particular
storm

Kurt

help

backing

No
one
had
charged
him
with
anything
more
serious
than
naivety

now
he

of
the
most
successful
fashion
designers
in
New
York

business
dealings
never
figured
very
largely
in

were
other

more
important

life

you
are
a

now
,
and
I
dare
say
the
truth
will
come
out
whether
I
tell
you
or
not
.
Your
mother
was
having
an
affair
with
Greg
Martin
.
She
was
besotted
by
him
.
When
she
followed
him
to
Italy
I
believe
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
us
and
go
to
him
.
That
was
why
what
happened
on
the
boat
makes
very
little
difference
to
me
.
Whether
she
was
killed
or
not
is
almost
immaterial
.
As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
she
was
dead
to
me
the
moment
she
walked
out
the
door
.
"
Harriet
crossed
to
the
window
and
looked
out
.
The
towers
of
Manhattan
seemed
almost
to
be
touching
the
cold
grey
sky
.
Far
below
,
in
the
street
opposite
the
550
building
,
stood
the
tall
statue
of
the
Garment
Worker
,
strangely
distorted
from
this
angle
,
and
around
the
plinth
on
which
it
stood
ant-like
figures
of
vagrants
and
layabouts
sat
,
oblivious
to
the
cold
.
For
long
minutes
Harriet
stared
down
,
unseeing
.
It
was
not
her
father
's
revelation
of
an
affair
that
surprised
her
.
The
official
story
had
always
been
that
Greg
was
simply
a
close
family
friend
,
but
a
child
could
have
seen
through
the
pretence
and
she
had
not
been
a
child
for
a
very
long
time
,
perhaps
not
since
that
long-ago
night
when
she
was
four
years
old
and
had
stood
,
unseen
,
outside
a
bedroom
door
-
No
,
it
was
her
father
's
attitude
that
had
shocked
her
.
"
She
was
dead
to
me
,
"
he
had
said
and
she
could
see
he
meant
it
.
She
was
used
to
his
ostrich
ways
-
his
ability
to
bury
his
head
in
the
sand
and
shut
out
the
things
that
displeased
or
upset
him
.
But
all
the
same
-
Harriet
gave
her
head
a
small
shake
,
hardly
able
to
believe
that
even
he
could
be
quite
so
coldly
dismissive

The
door
closed
after
them
and
Harriet
could
do
nothing
but
glare
at
it
impotently
.
Dammit
,
he
deserved
to
be
reported
to
whatever
professional
body
insurance
investigators
belonged
to
and
if
he
upset
her
father
she
'd
see
to
it
that
he
was
.
Still
fuming
at
the
insensitive
arrogance
of
the
man
she
turned
and
left
the
office
.
In
her
room
at
Hugo
's
Central
Park
triplex
Harriet
was
dressed
and
ready
for
dinner
.
At
home
in
London
she
rarely
bothered
with
such
irrelevances
;
here
she
knew
it
was
expected
of
her
and
accordingly
she
had
showered
,
dumped
her
travel-weary
jeans
into
the
laundry
basket
from
which
they
would
be
rescued
by
a
maid
,
washed
,
ironed
and
returned
to
her
next
day
,
and
dressed
herself
in
a
loose
silk
jersey
jacket
and
pants
suit
,
simple
and
easy
enough
to
please
her
yet
enough
of
a
transformation
to
satisfy
her
father
and
Sally
.
She
was
tired
out
now
,
her
eyes
ached
from
lack
of
sleep
and
jet-lag
,
and
she
glanced
longingly
at
the
king-sized
bed
with
its
lace-trimmed
peach
silk
sheets
.
Oh
to
be
able
to
fall
into
it
and
sink
into
oblivion
!
But
it
would
be
several
more
hours
yet
before
she
could
do
that
.
Was
her
father
home
yet
?
she
wondered
.
She
was
anxious
to
see
him
the
moment
he
arrived
,
and
make
sure
he
was
all
right
after
the
trauma
of
the
interview
with
the
insurance
investigator
.
But
when
she
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
looked
down
she
could
see
that
his
study
door
was
ajar
and
the
house
was
quiet
and
she
returned
to
her
room
.
He
had
said
he
might
be
late
,
after
all
,
and
she
decided
to
snatch
a
few
more
moments
of
privacy
to
recharge
her
batteries
in
the
one
place
in
the
whole
luxurious
house
where
she
was
able
to
relax
and
feel
she
was
her
own
person
.
What
was
it
about
unashamed
luxury
,
Harriet
sometimes
asked
herself
,
which
made
her
feel
so
uncomfortable
?
Most
people
would
be
only
to
happy
to
be
able
to
enjoy
such
surroundings
.
A
top
line
interior
decorator
had
been
given
a
free
hand
when
Hugo
had
bought
the
triplex
two
years
ago
and
no
expense
had
been
spared
-
the
walls
were
hung
with
some
of
Hugo
's
collection
of
Old
Masters
,
glowing
against
the
background
of
watered
silk
,
the
shelves
were
lined
with
leather
bound
first
editions
which
neither
Hugo
nor
Sally
would
ever
open
,
much
less
read
,
every
nook
and
cranny
was
filled
with
treasures
and
objets
d'art
displayed
on
dainty
pedestals
.
The
sofas
and
chairs
were
deep
and
soft
enough
to
fall
asleep
in
,
a
fireplace
was
topped
by
an
Adam
mantel
which
Hugo
had
had
flown
out
from
England
and
everywhere
there
were
fresh
flowers
-
long
stemmed
hothouse
roses
,
orchids
flown
in
from
Singapore
,
daffodils
and
narcissi
and
heavy
perfumed
hyacinths
.
But
to
Harriet
the
grandeur
and
studied
comfort
were
somehow
artificial
,
the
atmosphere
more
reminiscent
of
a
luxury
hotel
than
a
home
.
Perhaps
,
she
thought
,
it
was
because
she
had
never
lived
in
this
house
.
There
was
nothing
to
arouse
childhood
memories
.
Only
in
the
room
Sally
had
chosen
especially
for
her
was
Harriet
amongst
familiar
echoes
of
the
past
and
she
never
entered
it
without
feeling
a
wave
of
gratitude
towards
her
aunt
.
Here
,
at
Sally
's
instigation
,
were
many
of
the
things
Harriet
remembered
and
loved
from
her
childhood
and
growing-up
years
-
the
rosettes
she
had
won
with
her
pony
,
her
graduation
dress
,
her
old
collection
of
Osmond
and
Jackson
records
,
her
early
attempts
at
photography
,
proudly
framed
,
a
pressed
flower
that
reminded
her
of
her
first
proper
date
.
Small
things
,
but
important
,
the
little
touches
that
were
typical
of
Sally
and
which
made
it
possible
to
feel
charity
-
and
love
-
for
her
when
she
was
fussy
or
critical
or
just
plain
annoying
as
she
had
been
when
Harriet
had
arrived
without
warning
this
afternoon
.
"
Why

n't

Sally
had
chided
when
the
taxi
had
dropped
Harriet
off
and
she
had
bundled
unceremoniously
into
the
house
.

Danny
was
the
chauffeur
.
Harriet
picked
up
her
hold-all
and
escaped
.
She
was
puzzled
by
Sally
's
reaction
.
Anger
,
yes
,
she
'd
expected
that
.
But
Sally
had
seemed
really
upset
,
not
at
all
her
usual
contained
self
.
She
was
getting
quite
neurotic
,
Harriet
reflected
,
and
the
same
thought
occurred
to
her
now
as
she
checked
her
image
in
the
full
length
mirror
,
tucking
her
camisole
top
more
neatly
in
at
the
waist
of
her
pants
and
straightening
the
ornamental
clasp
of
the
loose
belt
she
had
fastened
around
her
hips
.
She
only
hoped
Sally
was
able
to
get
hold
of
Mark
.
It
would
be
nice
to
see
him
and
his
presence
would
lighten
things
.
Mark
always
managed
to
be
deliciously
irreverent
,
no
matter
how
heavy
things
got
.
It
was
the
English
in
him
,
she
supposed
,
that
laid-back
refusal
to
take
himself
-
or
anyone
else
-
seriously
.
Somewhere
in
the
house
a
telephone
was
ringing
.
Harriet
took
no
notice
of
it
but
a
minute
or
two
later
there
was
a
tap
at
her
door
and
a
maid
stood
there
with
one
of
the
portable
receivers
-
there
was
no
extension
in
Harriet
's
room
.
"
For
me
?
"
she
asked
,
surprised
.
The
maid
nodded
.
Harriet
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
after
her
and
flicked
the
button
,
feeling
oddly
apprehensive
.
The
last
thirty-six
hours
had
held
too
many
unpleasant
shocks
for
comfort
.

stirred

Then
he
was
gone
and
she
held
the
receiver
for
a
moment
feeling
unexpectedly
bereft
.
He
was
so
good
to
her
.
So
caring
.
Why
could
n't
she
let
him
in
to
that
private
part
of
herself
that
sometimes
cried
out
for
-
what
?
But
she
could
n't
.
Nick
was
there
for
her
and
she
was
grateful
,
but
that
was
all
.
The
moment
she
knew
it
she
did
n't
want
him
any
more
,
simple
as
that
.
What
the
hell
is
the
matter
with
me
?
Harriet
wondered
briefly
.
She
glanced
at
her
watch
.
Half
an
hour
or
so
to
dinner
.
She
might
as
well
go
down
,
have
a
pre-dinner
drink
with
Sally
and
see
if
her
father
was
home
yet
.
Halfway
down
the
stairs
she
heard
voices
and
through
the
partly-open
drawing-room
door
caught
a
glimpse
of
Sally
in
peacock-blue
cashmere
and
the
tall
figure
of
a
young
man
,
fine
hair
above
a
chestnut
brown
suede
jacket
.
Her
heart
leaped
and
she
ran
the
rest
of
the
way
like
a
child
in
her
delight
.

Harriet
said
decisively
.
At
that

Sally
knocked
over
her
glass
of
wine

ran
in
a
red
river
across
the
polished
table
top

cascaded
onto
her
peacock-blue
cashmere

leaped
up

at

a
napkin

hurried
from

up

Hugo

In
her

Sally
eventually
managed
to
get
out
of
her
dress
though
her
hands
were
trembling
so
much
she
had
great
difficulty
with
the
zipper
.
Then
she
kicked
it
away
and
sank
onto
the
bed
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
God
in
heaven
,
where
was
this
nightmare
going
to
end
?
Was
it
really
only
the
day
before
yesterday
when
everything
had
been
so
pleasant
and
normal
?
When
she
had
been
able
to
plan
her
charity
lunches
and
her
dinner
parties
,
go
shopping
,
gossip
with
friends
,
look
at
her
life
and
know
that
at
last
she
had
achieved
all
she
had
ever
wanted
,
even
If
sometimes
it
was
a
little
lonely
,
a
little
empty
?
Now
in
every
corner
,
wherever
she
looked
,
the
ghosts
of
the
past
seemed
to
be
congregating
to
mock
her
until
she
felt
sure
she
must
be
going
mad
.
A
tap
at
the
door
and
without
waiting
for
her
answer
it
opened
a
fraction
.
"
Sally

"
It
was
Harriet

voice

Harriet

anxious
face
peeping
round
.
"
Are
you
all
right

"
"
Yes
.
"
Somehow
she
got
a
hold
of
herself
and
went
to
pick
up
her
dress
.
"
How

so
clumsy

Sally
let
her
take
it
.
Then
before
she
could
stop
herself
she
asked
:

Harriet
's
brows
came
together
in
a
puzzled
little
line
.
"
Dad
said
something
similar
.

Sally
said
nothing
,
and
Harriet
went
on
:
"
You

For
a
moment
Sally
did
not
answer

"

a
very
determined
lady

she
said
,
avoiding
Harriet
's
eyes
.
"
She

"
"

,
Sally
said
softly
.
"

"
She
crossed
to
one
of
her
closets

sliding
hangers
along
the
rail
.
"

down
in

"
For
a
moment
longer
Harriet
hesitated
,
then
she
nodded
.
"

you

"
Yes

"
The
door
closed
after
Harriet
,
and
Sally
rifled
through
her
wardrobe
looking
for
a
dress
of
mauve-sprigged
white
seersucker
,
slightly
yellowed
now
,
and
quite
out
of
place
amongst
the
designer
gowns
.
She
should
have
thrown
it
out
years
ago
but
somehow
she
'd
never
had
the
heart
.
She
'd
loved
that
dress
,
felt
so
grown
up
in
it
!
She
slipped
it
off
its
hanger
and
held
it
against
herself
and
it
was
almost
as
if
the
face
looking
back
at
her
from
the
mirror
across
it
was
fourteen
years
old
again
.
As
she
stood
there
holding
it
the
memories
came
flooding
back
-
and
not
all
of
them
pleasant
.
For
she
had
been
wearing
this
dress
the
night
she
had
first
glimpsed
the
truth
about
her
sister
,
a
truth
that
was
as
unpalatable
now
as
it
had
been
then
.
"
Oh
Paula
!
"
she
whispered
and
suddenly
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
,
making
rivulets
in
her
carefully-applied
make-up
.
"
What
happened
to
you
?
And
dear
God
,
what
happened
to
me
?
"
She
stood
quite
still
,
holding
the
dress
with
arms
folded
around
her
waist
,
and
remembered
.
As
she
climbed
the
stairs
Sally
could
hear
the
low
voices
and
the
giggles
coming
from
the
bedroom
she
shared
with
her
sister
and
knew
what
it
meant
.
Paula
had
brought
her
friend
Louise
home
with
her
and
they
would
be
sharing
the
sort
of
older-girl
talk
that
always
made
Sally
feel
like
an
intruder
-
and
a
very
gauche
,
childish
intruder
at
that
.
She
hesitated
,
torn
between
the
unaccountable
shyness
she
always
felt
in
Louise
's
presence
and
the
overwhelming
desire
to
be
in
on
whatever
it
was
they
were
giggling
about
,
even
if
she
was
only
a
barely
tolerated
spectator
.
Fascination
with
the
older
girls
won
just
as
it
always
did
and
she
crossed
the
landing
,
an
expanse
of
lino
dotted
with
what
her
mother
referred
to
as
"
slip
mats
"
,
pushed
open
the
door
and
went
in
.
Two
pairs
of
accusing
eyes
focused
on
her
.
Paula
,
wearing
tight
pedal
pushers
and
a
cotton
off-the-shoulder
jersey
,
was
sprawled
on
her
elbows
on
the
tiled
fire-surround
,
smoking
and
puffing
the
smoke
up
the
chimney
whilst
Louise
,
stripped
to
her
sexy
black
lace
underwear
,
was
lying
on
the
bed
pounding
at
her
thighs
with
some
kind
of
massager
which
appeared
to
consist
of
a
collection
of
rubber
pimples
on
a
brush
head
.
"

Paula
demanded

Louise
said
,
still
pounding
away
at
what
she
considered
to
be
her
fat
legs
.
Louise
was
French
and
luscious
,
as
every
male
in
the
district
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
eighty-four
would
testify
-
most
from
wishful
thinking
but
quite
a
number
from
experience
.
Louise
was
what
was
known
as
an
"
exchange
student
"
;
at
home
in
Nîmes
she
was
training
to
be
an
English
teacher
and
she
was
doing
a
year
's
exchange
as
part
of
her
course
,
teaching
French
conversation
at
the
local
grammar
school
.
She
and
Paula
,
who
was
in
the
sixth
form
,
had
struck
up
a
close
relationship
;
when
Louise
was
not
occupied
in
tantalising
and
inflaming
some
poor
young
man
she
and
Paula
were
always
together
,
drinking
endless
cups
of
espresso
coffee
to
the
accompaniment
of
Elvis
and
Cliff
and
Tommy
Steele
on
the
juke-box
in
the
Black
Cat
Coffee
Bar
,
haring
about
on
Louise
's
smart
little
Lambretta
scooter

simply
spending
an
evening
painting
one
another
's
toenails
,
plucking
one
another
's
eyebrows
and
generally
trying
to
make
themselves
even
more
fatally
attractive
to
the
opposite
sex
,
which
,
without
doubt
,
they
already
were

Sally
was
unsure
whether
to
be
pleased
that

called

was
n't
fat

then
neither

perhaps
it
was
all
right

slipped
out

cotton

the
enormously
full

nylon
petticoat

It
lay
like
a
great
wounded
butterfly
on
the
rug
.
Then
she
sat
on
the
bed
,
trying
not
to
wince
as
Louise
rubbed
cream
into
her
thighs
and
pounded
at
them
enthusiastically
.
"
What
are
you
wearing
to
the
youth
club
dance
on
Saturday
night
,
Louise
?
"
Paula
asked
,
stubbing
out
her
cigarette
and
concealing
the
end
in
an
empty
lozenge
tin
she
used
as
an
ashtray
.
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
-
"
The
older
girls
drifted
off
into
one
of
their
exclusive
conversations
and
Sally
bit
her
lip
against
the
rasp
of
Louise
's
massager
and
wished
desperately
that
she
could
go
to
the
youth
club
dance
too
.
Not
only
would
it
make
her
feel
almost
as
grown
up
as
Paula
and
Louise
,
but
Pete
Jackson
,
with
whom
Sally
was
hopelessly
in
love
,
was
certain
to
be
there
.
Pete
was
in
her
form
at
school
and
whenever
she
looked
at
him
little
quivers
she
could
not
identify
started
deep
inside
her
.
Sometimes
she
thought
from
the
way
he
seemed
to
watch
her
that
he
might
like
her
too
but
he
had
never
said
anything
and
Sally
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
he
never
would
.
But
if
they
were
to
meet
away
from
school
,
out
of
uniform
,
no
longer
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
masters
and
mistresses
in
their
chalk-marked
black
gowns
,
then
maybe
it
would
be
different
.
"
Do
you
think
Mum
would
let
me
come
too
?
"
she
asked
.
"
I
should
n't
think
so
,
"
Paula
said
quickly
.
"
There
is
someone
you
fancy
?
"
Louise
asked
perceptively
,
and
when
Sally
blushed
she
turned
to
Paula
.
"
Oh
,
we
could
tell
your
mother
we
will
look
after
her
.
Then
she
would
let
her
go
,
no
?
"
"
No
!
"
Paula
protested
.
Most
of
her
life
,
it
seemed
to
her
,
she
had
been
hampered
by
having
to
look
after
Sally
and
she
had
no
intention
of
having
her
Saturday
evening
's
fun
spoiled
.
There
was
a
boy
she
fancied
herself
-
Jeff
Freeman
-
and
she
was
busy
laying
plans
to
entice
him
away
from
his
steady
girlfriend
.
The
presence
of
her
kid
sister
would
inhibit
her
horribly
.
"
She
has
n't
got
anything
to
wear
anyway
"
,
she
continued
scathingly
.
"
Then
I
shall
lend
her
something
of
mine
.
We
are
about
the
same
size
,
no
?
I
shall
make
her
so
beautiful
no
boy
will
be
able
to
resist
.
"
She
ran
the
massager
up
the
inside
of
Sally
's
thigh
again
but
suddenly
it
did
not
hurt
any
more
.
As
the
rim
brushed
her
groin
Sally
felt
a
sharp
sweet
pleasure
which
seemed
to
shoot
up
inside
her
on
silken
cords
to
that
deep
core
where
the
trickles
of
excitement
played
every
time
she
thought
of
Pete
.
As
Louise
moved
away
she
experienced
a
powerful
urge
to
grab
the
massager
and
tug
it
close
to
her
secret
places
again
but
she
did
not
dare
.
She
just
lay
thinking
how
wonderful
it
would
be
if
she
could
actually
make
Pete
notice
her
.
It
had
always
seemed
such
an
impossible
dream
,
but
with
Louise
talking
about
it
so
matter-of-factly
it
seemed
almost
a
fait
accompli
.
Much
to
Paula
's
annoyance
Louise
persuaded
Gwen
Bristow
to
allow
Sally
to
go
to
the
dance
.
Sally
was
triumphant
,
but
by
the
time
Saturday
came
she
was
almost
sick
with
excitement
and
apprehension
.
Oh
,
if
only
she
looked
more
like
Paula
!
she
thought
longingly
.
If
only
she
could
lose
her
puppy
fat
and
get
her
hair
done
at
a
proper
salon
instead
of
having
it
cut
by
Ivy
Tucker
who
lived
down
the
road
and
who
did
hairdressing
for
pin
money
.
But
it
was
n't
easy
to
lose
puppy
fat
when
Mum
fed
her
on
stodgy
good
home
cooking
-
stews
with
dumplings
and
meat
pies
with
pastry
crusts
and
steamed
sponge
puddings
,
and
there
was
no
money
to
spare
for
proper
hairdressing
salons
.
Sally
knew
her
mother
had
trouble
making
ends
meet
on
the
nine
pounds
ten
shillings
a
week
that
her
father
brought
home
from
his
job
as
an
electrician
's
mate
and
she
did
n't
have
the
heart
to
plead
for
luxuries
she
knew
they
could
not
afford
as
Paula
did
.
Too
often
she
had
seen
her
mother
frowning
with
anxiety
as
she
divided
the
contents
of
her
father
's
wage
packet
up
between
the
jars
labelled
"
Rent
"
and
"
Electric
"
and
"
Coal
Money
"
,
too
often
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
had
watched
her
count
out
the
pennies
for
a
pound
of
sausages
only
to
be
able
to
buy
just
a
half-pound
,
two
for
her
father
,
one
each
for
Paula
and
Sally
,
and
only
the
scrapings
of
the
pan
to
go
with
her
own
potatoes
.
"
When
I
grow
up
I
'll
make
sure
I
've
always
got
enough
money
for
a
whole
pound
of
sausages
and
eggs
to
go
with
them
,
"
Sally
thought
,
but
she
never
said
anything
.
She
did
not
want
to
add
to
her
mother
's
troubles
.
At
four
o'clock
Louise
arrived
on
her
scooter
and
parked
it
outside
the
Bristows
'
council
house
.
The
house
was
semi-detached
,
which
put
them
on
a
higher
social
level
than
the
people
who
lived
in
the
long
uniform
ranks
,
a
pleasant
,
gravel-faced
house
which
had
been
built
after
the
war
and
which
had
a
good
sized
garden
back
and
front
,
three
bedrooms
,
a
bathroom
-
and
an
outside
toilet
,
coal
house
and
glory
hole
.
Sally
loved
the
house
.
Before
moving
into
it
the
family
had
lived
with
Sally
's
grandparents
and
it
had
been
very
cramped
.
Their
grandparents
had
made
the
lounge
into
a
bedroom
so
that
Grandad
did
n't
have
to
do
the
stairs
with
his
bad
legs
and
a
bedroom
had
been
turned
into
a
sitting
room
and
furnished
with
a
table
,
chairs
and
sideboard
that
her
parents
had
acquired
when
they
got
married
though
they
had
no
house
to
put
it
in
.
When
Paula
and
Sally
played
records
on
the
wind-up
gramophone
in
the
sitting
room
Grandad
banged
on
the
ceiling
with
his
stick
to
warn
them
to
be
quieter
.
After
this
the
council
house
seemed
the
height
of
luxury
to
Sally
.
She
kept
rabbits
in
a
hutch
in
the
back
garden
behind
the
rows
of
cabbages
and
the
clump
of
rhubarb
and
did
not
mind
at
all
that
in
winter
she
had
to
wash
at
night
in
a
bowl
set
on
a
sheet
of
brown
paper
in
front
of
the
living
room
fire
because
there
was
no
heater
in
the
bathroom
.
Louise
was
carrying
a
large
bag
which
she
had
managed
to
balance
on
the
handlebars
of
her
scooter
.
Paula
and
Sally
took
her
straight
up
to
their
bedroom
.
"
Thees
is
the
dress
I
bring
for
you
,
"
she
announced
,
pulling
it
out
of
its
tissue
paper
and
spreading
it
,
slightly
creased
,
on
the
bed
.
"
You
like
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
!
"
Sally
gasped
.
It
was
a
beautiful
dress
,
white
seersucker
dotted
with
small
mauve
flowers
.
It
had
a
deep
"
sweetheart
"
neckline
,
little
puffed
sleeves
and
a
full
skirt
gathered
into
three
tiers
.
Next
out
of
the
bag
came
a
paper
nylon
petticoat
with
many
more
layers
of
frothy
rainbow-coloured
net
than
the
one
Sally
carefully
washed
in
sugar
water
after
each
wearing
,
and
then
,
to
Sally
's
delight
,
a
saucy
little
white
basque
,
boned
and
trimmed
with
lace
.
"
She
ca
n't
possibly
wear
that
!
"
Paula
exclaimed
,
scandalised
.
"
She
's
much
too
young
-
and
it
will
never
fit
her
,
anyway
.
"
"
Of
course
it
will
.
It
fits
me
.
And
with
this
dress
she
needs
a
tiny
waist
.
Why
ca
n't
she
wear
it
?
"
"
You
could
have
lent
it
to
me
,
"
Paula
said
,
peeved
.
"
No
,
it
is
for
Sally
.
Please
try
it
on
,
Sally
.
"
Sally
held
her
breath
as
Louise
fastened
the
multitude
of
little
hooks
and
eyes
and
tried
not
to
notice
the
little
roll
of
fat
that
squeezed
out
above
and
below
it
.
"
Now
the
petticoat
.
"
It
rustled
satisfyingly
.
"
And
the
dress
-
well
,
what
do
you
think
,
Sally
?
"
Sally
tipped
the
dressing
table
mirror
to
get
a
view
first
of
her
top
half
,
then
her
lower
.
"
It
's
lovely
-
but
what
about
shoes
?
Mine
are
clumsy
and
awful
.
"
Louise
dived
into
her
carrier
bag
again
.
"
Voila
!
"
she
said
,
producing
a
pair
of
strappy
white
sandals
.
Sally
squeezed
her
feet
into
them
and
surveyed
her
image
again
.
Unbelievable
!
Just
wait
until
Pete
saw
her
!
He
was
certain
to
ask
her
to
dance
when
she
looked
like
this
!
"
Now
-
your
hair
,
"
Louise
said
matter-of-factly
.
"
We
will
make
it
wet
and
put
it
in
rags
.
It
will
be
dry
by
the
time
we
leave
for
the
dance
.
"
Sure
enough
,
it
was
.
When
the
rags
came
out
the
mass
of
frizz
made
Sally
screech
with
horror
but
when
Louise
had
teased
it
a
little
with
her
Mason
Pearson
brush
and
a
long
tail
comb
Sally
saw
that
the
usually
severe
schoolgirlish
cut
had
been
transformed
into
a
mop
of
pretty
curls
.
Paula
and
Louise
were
looking
lovely
too
-
Paula
in
a
little
white
top
with
a
boat
shaped
neck
and
a
bright
turquoise
circular
skirt
,
Louise
in
a
figure
hugging
number
which
left
none
of
her
curves
to
the
imagination
-
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
Sally
felt
she
could
compete
with
them
on
equal
terms
.
"
Be
sure
to
come
straight
home
after
the
dance
.
And
make
sure
you
stay
together
,
"
Grace
warned
.
Paula
pursed
her
lips
and
tossed
her
head
,
looking
annoyed
.
But
Sally
scarcely
noticed
.
By
nine-thirty
the
dance
was
in
full
swing
.
As
it
was
a
special
fundraising
dance
instead
of
the
regularly
fortnightly
hop
,
a
three-piece
band
had
been
brought
in
to
replace
the
usual
stack
of
gramophone
records
and
there
was
"
real
food
"
-
fishpaste
sandwiches
,
sausage
rolls
and
cheese
and
pineapple
on
sticks
-
which
the
"
committee
"
had
spent
the
entire
afternoon
preparing
.
Paula
and
Louise
had
been
nominated
to
sell
the
raffle
tickets
and
did
a
round
of
the
hall
,
flirting
outrageously
and
telling
all
the
boys
the
tickets
were
"
sixpence
each
or
two
shillings
a
strip
"
.
Naturally
most
of
the
boys
opted
for
"
the
strip
"
and
each
time
the
innuendo
was
made
the
girls
pretended
it
was
terribly
witty
and
original
,
If
a
little
naughty
,
just
as
they
did
when
they
were
asked
for
the
twentieth
time
if
perhaps
they
might
be
the
prize
.
Selling
the
tickets
gave
Paula
an
opportunity
to
make
her
play
for
Jeff
Freeman
.
She
waited
for
Jean
,
his
girlfriend
,
to
go
to
the
Ladies
,
and
then
pounced
,
flirting
madly
and
manoeuvring
him
into
bartering
with
her
that
he
would
buy
two
whole
strips
if
she
would
have
a
dance
with
him
.
Then
without
the
slightest
compunction
she
thrust
her
basin
of
money
and
book
of
tickets
into
Sally
's
lap
and
let
him
drag
her
,
protesting
theatrically
,
onto
the
dance
floor
.
When
Jean
returned
from
the
Ladies
there
was
no
sign
of
either
of
them
,
for
at
the
end
of
the
dance
they
had
slipped
unnoticed
out
of
one
of
the
wide-open
fire
exits
and
around
the
back
of
the
hall
where
only
courting
couples
went
.
Half
an
hour
later
they
were
still
missing
.
When
she
finished
selling
the
remaining
tickets
Sally
looked
around
for
them
,
realised
what
had
happened
and
went
back
to
sit
on
one
of
the
hard
upright
chairs
which
lined
the
hall
.
She
was
feeling
wretched
.
For
her
,
the
evening
had
not
turned
out
at
all
as
she
had
hoped
.
Several
boys
had
asked
her
to
dance
but
she
had
refused
them
all
,
afraid
she
might
miss
her
chance
with
Pete
,
but
he
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
her
at
all
in
spite
of
Louise
's
dress
.
Once
she
had
thought
he
was
coming
in
her
direction
and
her
heart
had
begun
to
pump
with
excitement
but
he
had
walked
straight
past
,
heading
for
the
bar
that
was
selling
soft
drinks
only
(
with
a
crate
of
beer
hidden
under
the
counter
for
the
benefit
of
the
band
)
.
Tears
pricked
her
eyes
and
she
stared
hard
at
the
floor
.
"
Wan
na
dance
?
"
a
voice
enquired
and
Sally
looked
up
to
see
a
boy
in
a
velvet-collared
jacket
,
drainpipes
and
crepe-soled
shoes
standing
in
front
of
her
,
a
lick
of
greasy
hair
falling
across
a
face
shiny
with
perspiration
.
"
No
thank
you
,
"
she
started
to
say
,
then
caught
sight
of
Pete
-
dancing
with
someone
else
.
Her
heart
dropped
like
a
stone
and
somehow
she
got
to
her
feet
.
The
boy
grabbed
her
hand
with
his
sweaty
one
.
She
danced
in
a
haze
of
misery
,
scarcely
noticing
when
the
music
changed
from
vibrant
rock-and-roll
to
"
the
creep
"
and
when
the
lights
were
lowered
and
he
pulled
her
close
she
could
n't
be
bothered
to
protest
though
she
was
revolted
by
the
smell
of
beer
on
his
breath
(
where
had
he
got
it
?
)
mingling
with
strong
body
odours
.
The
teddy-boy
seemed
to
take
her
listlessness
for
acquiescence
.
His
hands
strayed
down
to
a
spot
just
below
the
first
frill
on
her
skirt
and
he
pushed
his
hips
against
hers
so
that
she
could
clearly
feel
the
bulge
between
his
legs
.
Suddenly
it
was
all
to
much
for
Sally
.
She
grabbed
his
hands
and
removed
them
from
her
bottom
.
Then
she
turned
and
fled
from
the
dance
floor
,
pushing
her
way
between
the
smooching
couples
and
heading
for
the
Ladies
,
a
box
of
a
room
with
pegs
lining
two
walls
,
a
flyblown
mirror
over
a
grubby
cracked
china
sink
and
two
cubicles
.
Ignoring
the
girls
who
were
primping
in
front
of
the
mirror
she
ran
to
the
cubicles
and
dived
inside
one
,
slamming
the
door
after
her
and
leaning
against
it
.
What
a
disaster
!
If
only
she
could
just
go
home
,
hide
away
and
never
have
to
see
anyone
again
-
but
she
had
promised
to
stick
with
Paula
and
there
would
be
all
kinds
of
awkward
questions
and
recriminations
if
she
arrived
home
alone
.
High
heels
pattered
across
the
cloakroom
floor
and
someone
pushed
at
the
toilet
door
.
"
Damn
,
"
said
a
voice
outside
.
"
They
're
both
occupied
.
"
"
Never
mind
,
they
wo
n't
be

"

soon
it
'll
be
time
for
my
last
bus
and
I
ca
n't
go
without
seeing
him
.
He
is
supposed
to
be
my
boyfriend
,
after
all
.
"
"
Supposed

be
.
Some
boyfriend
if
you
ask
me
!
"
Sally
stood
motionless
.
She
had
recognised
the
voices
-
Jean
,
Jeff
's
girl
and
her
friend
,
Peggy
.
"
I
would
n't
stand
for
it
If
I
were
you
,
"
Peggy
was
saying
indignantly
.
"
I
would
n't
let
him
treat
me
like
that
.
"
"
It
's
not
his
fault
.
It
's
that
Paula
Bristow
-
Lady
Muck
herself
.
Who
does
she
think
she
is
?
"
Jean
's
voice
was
rising
;
she
sounded
tearful
.
"
Do
n't
upset
yourself
,
Jean
.
He
's
not
worth
it
.
Nor
is
she
.
She
's
a
fast
cat
.
She
'll
let
the
boys
do
what
they
like
.
That
's
why
they
flock
round
her
.
You
ask
my
brother
.
The
things
he
could
tell
you
about
her
would
make
your
hair
curl
.
She
's
got
no
pride
.
She
just
does
n't
care
.
"
Sally
began
to
quiver
with
anger
.
Forgetting
her
own
misery
and
embarrassment
she
threw
open
the
door
.
"
That
's
my
sister
you
're
talking
about
!
"
For
a
moment
the
two
girls
stared
at
her
,
shocked
,
then
Peggy
recovered
herself
.
"
It
's
true
,
anyway
,
"
she
said
defiantly
.
"
And
you
're
as
bad
as
she
is
!
You
'll
let
any
boy
paw
you
too
.
I
saw
you
just
now
with
Gary
.
His
hands
were
all
over
you
!
"
"
You
're
just
jealous
!
"
Sally
cried
,
her
face
scarlet
.
She
pushed
past
the
girls
and
marched
over
to
the
wastepaper
bin
beneath
the
sink
.
It
was
full
of
used
cloakroom
tickets
,
torn
paper
towel
,
bits
of
face-powdery
cotton
wool
and
the
shavings
of
eyebrow
pencils
.
She
picked
it
up
,
went
back
to
the
two
girls
and
dumped
it
unceremoniously
over
Peggy
's
head
.
Then
she
ran
from
the
cloakroom
,
down
the
narrow
dark
passage
and
out
into
the
night
.
The
sound
of
merriment
emanating
from
the
hall
jangled
her
nerves
,
the
sight
of
the
courting
couples
pressed
against
the
wall
was
enough
to
bring
her
to
the
edge
of
tears
again
.
What
an
evening
!
Bad
enough
that
Pete
did
n't
want
her
.
But
to
overhear
Jean
and
Peggy
saying
those
things
about
Paula
was
somehow
almost
worse
,
for
in
her
heart
Sally
knew
they
were
not
far
removed
from
the
truth
.
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
as
if
the
veil
had
been
stripped
from
her
idol
and
she
was
looking
at
the
real
person
who
hid
away
inside
a
beautiful
body
,
seeing
her
through
the
eyes
of
others
who
had
no
family
love
for
her
to
colour
what
they
saw
.
Paula
was
a
flirt
.
She
did
think
she
was
a
little
bit
better
than
everyone
else
.
And
she
was
prepared
to
go
to
any
lengths
to
get
what
she
wanted
-
and
almost
always
succeeded
.
"
Oh
sugar
!
"
Sally
said
.
And
there
in
the
darkness
,
with
half
an
hour
to
wait
before
she
could
even
start
looking
for
Paula
with
a
view
to
going
home
,
she
began
to
cry
.
After
three
weeks
of
misery
Sally
woke
up
one
morning
and
realised
she
was
no
longer
in
love
with
Pete
.
The
fact
that
her
stomach
no
longer
turned
over
when
he
looked
at
her
came
as
a
surprise
and
disappointment
-
even
unrequited
love
was
better
than
no
love
at
all
.
A
fortnight
after
she
had
made
this
earth-shattering
discovery
she
was
amazed
when
he
stuttered
out
an
invitation
to
the
cinema
.
Hoping
to
rekindle
the
fire
Sally
accepted
,
but
it
was
no
use
.
Close
to
,
she
discovered
,
Pete
smelled
of
carbolic
soap
,
a
dreadful
turn-off
,
and
when
he
kissed
her
in
the
dark
it
was
so
wet
and
sloppy
she
longed
only
to
search
for
her
handkerchief
and
wipe
her
mouth
dry
.
During
the
next
year
Sally
fell
in
and
out
of
love
a
half
dozen
times
and
each
time
it
proved
to
be
just
as
disastrous
.
A
few
boys
asked
her
out
but
never
the
right
ones
,
never
the
ones
she
wanted
to
ask
her
,
and
Sally
began
to
wonder
how
two
people
ever
came
to
be
in
love
with
one
another
at
the
same
time
.
It
was
a
miracle
that
so
many
people
managed
it
-
and
for
long
enough
to
get
engaged
and
married
.
But
perhaps
they
were
luckier
than
she
was
,
or
just
plain
less
fussy
.
Paula
certainly
never
seemed
to
encounter
such
problems
.
She
had
a
string
of
boyfriends
and
no
matter
how
badly
she
treated
them
there
were
always
others
lined
up
and
waiting
.
But
then
of
course
Paula
was
so
lovely
she
had
only
to
look
at
a
boy
to
have
him
crazy
about
her
,
Sally
thought
wretchedly
.
Then
,
in
the
spring
when
she
was
sixteen
,
the
miracle
happened
.
His
name
was
Edward
Blake
and
he
was
nineteen
years
old
-
really
grown
up
!
Besides
this
he
was
stunningly
handsome
.
It
was
the
beginning
of
the
tennis
season
.
As
a
member
of
the
school
team
Sally
was
expected
to
stay
behind
after
school
to
practise
.
One
afternoon
after
an
especially
long
session
she
was
forced
to
catch
a
much
later
bus
home
than
usual
.
She
sprinted
across
the
playground
,
hampered
by
her
satchel
and
tennis
racket
,
just
as
the
bus
was
about
to
pull
away
,
and
leaped
aboard
.
The
bus
was
full
and
the
conductor
grumpy
.
"
Hold
on
tight
now
!
"
he
called
,
ringing
the
bell
.
Sally
staggered
down
the
aisle
,
trying
not
to
bang
the
other
passengers
with
her
tennis
racket
.
"
Let
me
take
that
,
"
said
a
male
voice
and
turning
she
found
herself
looking
into
a
pair
of
startlingly
blue
eyes
.
"
There
's
a
seat
here
,
"
he
went
on
,
moving
to
let
her
in
.
She
sat
down
,
settling
her
satchel
on
her
lap
and
stealing
another
glance
at
him
.
Thick
fair
hair
,
a
wonderful
complexion
-
not
a
sign
of
a
spot
!
-
and
those
blue
eyes
!
Sally
felt
a
little
flush
of
excitement
creeping
up
her
cheeks
and
she
was
acutely
conscious
of
her
gingham
uniform
dress
and
the
beret
which
school
rules
said
must
be
worn
at
all
times
when
outside
the
school
grounds
.
Failure
to
do
so
was
punished
by
being
forced
to
wear
the
hated
beret
for
a
whole
day
in
school
-
for
lessons
,
lunch
,
everything
,
a
badge
of
shame
Sally
had
so
far
managed
to
avoid
.
But
just
now
she
thought
she
would
willingly
endure
any
punishment
if
only
she
dared
take
her
hat
off
without
making
it
perfectly
obvious
she
was
making
a
pass
at
him
.
"
You
are
n't
usually
on
this
bus
,
"
he
said
and
Sally
felt
her
cheeks
grow
hotter
.
Oh
please
do
n't
let
me
blush
now
!
she
prayed
.
"
No
,
I
'm
late
.
I
've
been
playing
tennis
.
"
"
That
explains
it
.
"
He
shifted
the
racket
between
his
knees
.
"
Do
you
play
a
lot
?
"
"
When
I
can
.
"
"
Are
you
good
?
"
"
Not
bad
,
considering
the
shaky
start
I
had
.
When
I
was
a
first
year
I
was
put
in
as
ballboy
and
I
did
n't
know
the
rules
.
I
kept
throwing
the
ball
back
to
the
wrong
player
.
Every
time
I
thought
I
'd
got
the
hang
of
it
the
service
changed
.
And
then
I
was
sent
to
retrieve
the
balls
from
the
headmaster
's
garden
.
I
was
terrified
of
knocking
on
the
door
of
the
house
to
ask
permission
but
I
was
even
more
terrified
of
going
back
and
making
a
fool
of
myself
because
of
my
ignorance
on
court
so
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
skulking
behind
the
sweet
peas
.
"
He
laughed
.
He
had
a
nice
laugh
,
she
thought
.
They
chattered
until
Sally
realised
the
bus
was
pulling
up
at
her
stop
.
She
scrambled
to
her
feet
.
"
I
get
off
here
.
"
He
handed
her
her
racket
.
"

She
knew
her
cheeks
were
flaming
now
.

the
conductor
yelled
,
his
finger
on
the
bell
.
"
Can
you
get
to
Bath
?
I
'll
see
you

Saturday

half
past
seven

the
bus
stop

"
the
boy
said
.
"
Yes
,
all
right
-
"
She
staggered
down
the
gangway
,
shell-shocked
,
and
walked
home
feeling
as
if
she
was
floating
on
air
but
as
Saturday
approached
the
nervousness
began
.
she
could
get
a
bus
to
Bath
,
but
how
would
she
get
home
again
?
Where
would
he
take
her
?
What
should
she
wear
?
She
did
n't
even
know
his
name
but
she
did
know
that
this
time
she
was
IN
LOVE
!
The
question
of
what
to
wear
was
easily
settled
.
Louise
had
gone
back
to
Nîmes
now
but
she
had
left
Sally
the
white
dress
as
a
parting
gift
and
even
without
the
waspie-waisted
basque
it
was
by
far
the
nicest
thing
Sally
owned
.
She
wore
it
with
a
pair
of
new
white
sandals
and
a
lacy
white
cardigan
her
mother
had
knitted
for
her
.
At
a
quarter
past
seven
she
got
off
the
bus
in
Bath
worrying
that
he
might
stand
her
up
.
But
he
was
there
waiting
and
looked
more
handsome
than
ever
in
a
grey
suit
with
a
white
shirt
.
"
Would
you
like
to
go
to
the
dance
at
the
Regency

asked
.
"
Oh
yes

only
I

got

"
"
Do
n't
worry

I
'll

he
promised
.
The
Regency
had
once
been
a
Palace
of
Varieties
.
There
was
a
bar
selling
alcoholic
drinks
and
two
milk
bars
,
one
at
floor
level
,
one
in
what
had
once
been
the
balcony
,
and
a
huge
multi-faceted
glass
ball
which
hung
over
the
dance
floor
.
A
narrow
gallery
ran
around
the
other
three
sides
of
the
hall
from
which
it
was
possible
to
watch
the
dancers
or
enjoy
the
band
-
a
real
band
,
at
least
a
dozen
musicians
,
all
in
uniform
blazers
and
bow
ties
.
Sometimes
the
big
name
bands
came
to
the
Regency
-
Kenny
Ball
and
Ted
Heath
,
Acker
Bilk
and
The
Temperance
Seven
,
but
tonight
it
was
the
resident
band
.
The
whole
place
seemed
to
be
throbbing
with
the
music
they
made
.
Sally
left
her
bag
in
the
cloakroom
and
met
Edward
in
the
balcony
milk
bar
where
he
had
a
strawberry
milk
shake
waiting
for
her
.
She
sipped
it
through
a
straw
looking
around
with
interest
.
The
place
had
n't
filled
up
yet
but
she
noticed
that
the
boys
were
congregating
at
the
end
of
the
hall
beneath
the
balcony
and
on
the
left
hand
side
while
the
girls
were
spread
between
the
tables
and
chairs
on
the
opposite
wall
,
chatting
and
giggling
and
trying
to
pretend
they
were
not
waiting
to
be
asked
to
dance
.
A
few
girls
were
dancing
together
as
they
did
at
the
youth
club
hops
and
the
dancing
was
of
the
proper
"
ballroom
variety
"
-
waltzes
,
quicksteps
and
foxtrots
.
When
Edward
suggested
they
dance
Sally
was
grateful
for
the
lessons
she
had
endured
in
the
school
gymnasium
with
Miss
Smart
the
games
teacher
yelling
"
slow
,
slow
,
quick
quick
,
slow
"
in
time
to
the
music
.
Edward
danced
well
,
guiding
her
with
confidence
,
and
soon
he
was
holding
her
very
close
.
Unlike
Pete
he
smelled
nice
-
Sally
thought
it
was
Old
Spice
-
and
when
he
pressed
his
hips
against
hers
she
was
excited
by
the
sensations
it
aroused
,
not
revolted
as
she
had
been
with
the
Teddy
Boy
at
the
youth
club
dance
.
Over
his
shoulder
she
glanced
at
the
clock
over
the
door
-
the
hands
seemed
to
be
moving
very
fast
and
she
was
reluctant
to
say
it
was
time
she
was
going
.
At
last
she
could
postpone
it
no
longer
-
she
had
just
ten
minutes
to
get
to
her
bus
!
She
collected
her
bag
and
hand
in
hand
they
ran
all
the
way
-
just
in
time
to
see
the
bus
disappearing
along
the
road
.
"
Whatever
will
I
do
?
Mum
will
kill
me
!
"
Sally
wailed
.
"
Do
n't
worry
,
I
'll
get
you
a
taxi
,
"
he
promised
.
He
'd
never
ask
her
out
again
now
,
Sally
thought
gloomily
.
But
as
they
walked
to
the
taxi
rank
he
said
:
"
Could
you
get
into
Bath
in
the
week
?
We
could
go
to
the
pictures
,
"
and
she
agreed
happily
.
Edward
paid
the
taxi
driver
in
advance
and
all
the
way
home
she
sat
in
a
happy
daze
.
The
curtains
twitched
as
the
taxi
pulled
up
outside
her
house
and
her
mother
was
in
the
doorway
.
"
What
on
earth
are
you
doing
coming
home
in
a
taxi
?
"
"
Edward
got
it
for
me
.
"
"
Edward
is
it
?
Well
all
I
can
say
is
he
must
have
money
to
burn
!
"
"
He
just
wanted
to
make
sure
I
got
home
safely
,
"
Sally
said
smugly
.
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
she
had
outdone
Paula
,
who
had
never
,
ever
,
arrived
home
in
a
taxi
!
That
summer
was
the
most
exciting
Sally
had
ever
known
.
Twice
weekly
she
went
to
Bath
to
meet
Edward
,
though
ever
afterwards
he
made
sure
she
was
on
the
last
bus
home
.
Sometimes
they
went
to
the
cinema
,
sometimes
they
sat
in
coffee
bars
holding
hands
across
the
table
,
sometimes
they
walked
in
the
park
,
and
on
Saturdays
they
almost
always
went
to
the
dance
.
Sally
lived
in
a
happy
whirl
marred
only
by
worrying
about
how
far
she
should
go
.
After
the
first
few
dates
when
he
had
kissed
and
cuddled
her
and
only
touched
her
breasts
through
her
blouse
,
he
had
started
slipping
his
hand
inside
.
Although
she
felt
a
little
guilty
about
letting
him
do
it
Sally
found
she
quite
liked
the
feel
of
his
fingers
stroking
her
flesh
and
teasing
her
nipples
but
when
he
tried
to
put
his
hand
up
her
skirt
beneath
her
scratchy
petticoats
she
tried
to
stop
him
.
"
Do
n't
,
please
,
"
she
begged
,
grabbing
his
hand
.
"
Why
?
"
he
asked
,
creeping
up
further
.
"
Because
.
"
But
he
refused
to
take
no
for
an
answer
and
after
a
few
unseemly
tussles
Sally
decided
it
was
easier
to
give
in
and
let
him
explore
inside
the
leg
of
her
panties
.
At
first
it
was
n't
too
bad
but
soon
his
finger
was
prodding
right
inside
her
and
that
hurt
,
a
sharp
,
squeaky
sort
of
pain
like
someone
drawing
a
fingernail
across
a
sheet
of
plastic
.
As
he
prodded
around
all
the
dreamy
romantic
feelings
she
experienced
when
he
kissed
her
disappeared
and
all
she
could
think
of
was
when
would
he
stop
,
and
could
n't
he
please
just
hold
her
again
,
very
close
,
with
the
firm
bulge
of
his
body
against
her
,
far
more
erotic
through
several
layers
of
clothes
than
his
scratching
,
poking
finger
.
The
next
thing
was
that
he
wanted
her
to
hold
the
bulge
.
The
first
time
was
in
the
cinema
.
In
the
darkness
,
under
cover
of
which
they
had
been
kissing
cuddling
so
much
(
with
his
hand
inside
her
blouse
)
that
she
had
not
the
first
idea
what
the
film
was
about
,
he
took
her
hand
and
guided
it
down
to
his
lap
.
Sally
almost
jumped
as
she
encountered
the
rigid
roll
.
She
took
her
hand
away
,
but
Edward
only
replaced
it
.
What
was
she
supposed
to
do
?
Taking
a
deep
breath
she
gripped
the
roll
and
held
onto
it
,
not
moving
.
She
simply
could
n't
bring
herself
to
stroke
or
rub
it
.
But
Edward
seemed
satisfied
.
He
kissed
her
fervently
and
they
stayed
that
way
until
the
lights
went
up
and
the
usherettes
began
moving
down
the
aisles
with
their
trays
of
icecream
.
Sally
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
,
squinting
down
to
make
sure
her
blouse
was
done
up
properly
and
embarrassed
to
meet
Edward
's
eyes
.
Presumably
everybody
else
in
the
world
did
it
she
thought
.
But
remembering
still
made
her
blush
all
over
.
One
thing
she
was
quite
certain
of
-
she
was
in
love
with
Edward
and
that
meant
she
would
have
to
continue
to
let
him
-
or
he
would
find
someone
else
who
would
.
Boys
were
like
that
-
the
girls
at
school
said
so
.
The
trouble
was
that
if
you
permitted
intimacy
you
would
be
thought
of
as
"
cheap
"
and
perhaps
be
talked
about
as
the
girls
at
the
dance
had
talked
about
Paula
,
only
by
the
boys
,
which
was
worse
,
but
if
you
did
n't
no
boy
would
be
prepared
to
bother
with
you
for
long
.
The
dilemma
threatened
to
spoil
Sally
's
happiness
but
one
thing
she
was
certain
of
-
whatever
it
took
she
would
do
it
because
she
could
n't
bear
to
lose
him
.
"
Sally
,
I
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
,
"
Paula
said
.
Her
voice
had
that
familiar
note
that
was
halfway
between
wheedling
and
autocracy
and
Sally
's
heart
sank
.
When
Paula
used
that
tone
it
usually
meant
trouble
.
"
What
?
"
she
asked
,
rather
aggressively
.
"
Sally
!
"
Paula
gave
her
a
hurt
glare
.
"
I
do
n't
very
often
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
me
-
and
I
did
lend
you
my
ear-rings
when
you
went
out
with
that
Edward
last
week
.
"
"
All
right
-
what
is
it
you
want
?
"
"
Help
me

out

"
Once
a
fortnight
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
the
girls
went
to
tea
with
Gran
Bristow
in
the
little
house
that
had
once
been
their
home
.
Sally
quite
enjoyed
the
visits
but
Paula
had
no
patience
for
making
conversation
with
Gran
,
who
tended
to
have
very
old-fashioned
,
dyed-in-the-wool
ideas
and
was
easily
shocked
,
and
she
hated
having
to
eat
her
way
through
the
ham
salad
and
bread
and
butter
,
Victoria
sponge
and
tinned
fruit
and
cream
which
Gran
not
only
laid
on
but
also
piled
high
on
her
plate
because
she
thought
Paula
much
too
thin
.
"
Oh
Paula
!
"
Sally
scolded
.
"
You
know
how
Gran
looks
forward
to
seeing
us
.
And
Mum

Dad
are

off
on
holiday
on
Saturday
,

they
wo

popping
in

visit

a
couple
of
weeks

Exactly

That
's
why
you
can
tell
Gran
a

lie

any
different

sort

lie

Paula
's
face
took
on
a
vixenish
wickedness
.
"
I
did
think
you
could
say
I
had
a
cold
because
you
know
how
frightened
Gran
is
of
catching
colds
.
But
it
's
a
bit
boring
and
it
is
the
middle
of
summer
.
So
tell
her
I
broke
the
heel
on
my
shoe
as
we
were
walking
over

over

Sally
asked
reasonably
.
"

twisted
my
ankle

Sally
objected

In

Paula
said
slyly
,
"
I
might
just
tell
Mum

you

up

"
What
do
you
mean

"
Sally
demanded
,
but
a
scarlet
flush
was
creeping
up
her
neck
at
an
alarming
rate
and
flooding
her
cheeks
.
Paula
smiled
,
enjoying
her
sister
's
discomfort
-
and
the
feeling
of
power
it
gave
her
.
"
as
if
you
did
n't
know
!
But
if
you
really
want
me
to
go
into
details
Valerie
Mitchell
was
sitting
not
far
from
you
last
week
.
And
she
was
pretty
shocked
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
Valerie
Mitchell
lived
in
the
next
road
and
travelled
to
work
on
the
same
bus
as
Paula
.
What
she
had
actually
said
was
:
"
Your
little
sister
has
grown
up
,
has
n't
she
?
Well
,
enough
to
have
a
good
time
in
the
back
row
at
the
pictures
anyway
,
"
and
she
had
certainly
not
elaborated
.
But
Sally
was
not
to
know
that
and
she
was
mortified
.
Oh
God
,
if
Valerie
had
been
shocked
perhaps
she
was
going
too
far
!
And
if
Paula
should
tell
her
mother
she
thought
she
would
die
of
shame
!
"
I
should
n't
think
Mum
would
let
you
go
out
with
Edward
again
if
she
knew
what
you
get
up
to
,
"
Paula
said
carelessly
.
"
But
of
course
if
you
tell
Gran
about
my
broken
shoe
on
Sunday
there
really
wo
n't
be
any
need
for
her
to
know
.
"
"
Sometimes
I
hate
you

Sally
said
.
"
Sometimes
I
wish
you
were
n't
my
sister
.
You
really
are
n't
very
nice
at
all

Paula
shrugged
,
looking
very
smug
.
"
Who
cares
about
being
nice
?
"
she
asked
.
"
Getting
what
you
want
is
much
more
important
.
And
I
am
going
to
get
what
I
want
,
are
n't
I
?
"
Sally
nodded
.
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
in
a
small
,
ashamed
voice
.
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
you
are
.
You
always
do
.
"
In
spite
of
all
the
worrying
about
it
the
next
stage
with
Edward
still
took
Sally
by
surprise
when
it
actually
happened
.
They
were
in
a
dark
corner
behind
the
bandstand
in
the
park
and
had
quickly
gone
through
all
the
other
stages
,
including
the
one
Sally
liked
best
,
kissing
and
pressing
the
lower
half
of
their
bodies
close
together
as
if
they
were
dancing
.
Tonight
her
skirt
was
rucked
up
almost
to
her
waist
and
she
found
this
was
even
better
than
usual
because
the
bulge
fitted
neatly
between
her
thighs
and
touched
even
deeper
chords
of
excitement
.
So
ecstatic
was
she
that
she
did
not
notice
Edward
fumbling
with
his
clothes
until
she
became
aware
of
moist
clingy
flesh
,
thrusting
and
rubbing
.
Her
heart
came
into
her
mouth
with
a
great
choking
leap
.
"
Edward
-
stop
it
!
"
she
gasped
.
He
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
.
He
was
rocking
and
moaning
,
his
breathing
heavy
and
catchy
.
"
Edward
!
"
she
protested
,
wriggling
.
She
could
feel
the
tip
probing
up
the
leg
of
her
panties
and
she
knew
it
should
not
be
there
.
This
was
not
just
embarrassing
,
it
was
downright
dangerous
.
She
put
her
hand
down
to
push
him
away
and
he
grabbed
it
,
squeezing
it
around
the
erect
penis
and
forcing
her
to
rub
it
up
and
down
.
As
she
felt
the
muscular
ridges
pulsing
and
throbbing
she
almost
sobbed
aloud
from
a
mixture
of
fear
,
curiosity
and
excitement
,
but
at
least
the
thing
was
no
longer
between
her
legs
.
Then
she
felt
it
jerk
violently
and
Edward
shuddered
and
bit
her
neck
as
warm
sticky
fluid
spurted
into
her
hand
.
She
stood
quite
still
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
after
a
moment
he
pulled
away
,
reached
into
his
pocket
for
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
himself
,
his
hand
and
hers
.
Then
he
threw
his
handkerchief
into
a
bush
.
"
Ca
n't
take
that
home
,
"
he
said
with
a
shaky
laugh
.
Sally
felt
shaky
too
.
She
wriggled
her
skirt
down
over
her
thighs
and
when
she
risked
a
look
she
was
relieved
to
discover
Edward
had
done
his
trousers
up
again
.
Suddenly
she
longed
to
have
him
kiss
her
again
and
hold
her
close
.
That
would
somehow
make
everything
all
right
.
But
he
no
longer
seemed
interested
.
"
It
's
time
for
your
bus
,
"
he
said
.
Inexplicably
Sally
felt
like
crying
.
He
held
her
hand
as
they
walked
through
the
streets
but
Sally
could
not
feel
any
of
the
warmth
she
so
desperately
needed
.
It
was
a
clear
night
and
there
was
an
enormous
moon
which
was
reflected
in
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
Avon
-
it
should
be
so
romantic
,
Sally
thought
,
but
somehow
it
was
n't
.
She
felt
sadder
than
ever
.
"
I
'll
see
you
on
Saturday
,
same
time
,
same
place
,
"
Edward
said
giving
her
a
quick
peck
and
pushing
her
up
the
steps
of
the
bus
.
On
the
way
home
Sally
could
feel
people
looking
at
her
and
wondered
why
.
It
was
only
when
she
got
home
and
looked
in
the
hall
mirror
that
she
saw
the
enormous
dark
red
love
bite
on
her
neck
.
Quickly
she
covered
the
bruise
with
her
collar
.
Heaven
knew
how
she
would
conceal
it
at
school
tomorrow
,
especially
as
she
had
games
.
Perhaps
face
powder
or
foundation
?
Sally
felt
even
more
like
crying
.
She
loved
Edward
.
But
why
did
it
all
have
to
be
so
messy
and
complicated
?
Why
did
it
have
to
make
her
feel
so
horrid
and
ashamed
?
She
was
still
looking
in
the
mirror
making
sure
there
were
no
other
tell-tale
signs
of
the
evening
's
activities
when
the
living-room
door
was
thrown
open
and
her
mother
,
looking
very
stern
,
appeared
.
"
Sally
-
come
in
here
this
minute
!
"
she
ordered
.
Sally
quaked
inwardly
.
Oh
God
,
she
must
have
been
found
out
!
But
who
could
have
seen
her
in
the
park
and
reported
back
this
quickly
?
Nervously
smoothing
her
skirt
and
praying
there
were
no
stains
she
had
missed
,
she
went
along
the
hall
and
into
the
living
room
.
She
knew
at
once
it
was
serious
because
her
father
was
still
up
.
Having
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
mornings
he
tended
to
be
in
bed
by
the
time
she
arrived
home
on
the
last
bus
from
Bath
.
But
here
he
was
,
still
sitting
in
his
chair
(
and
looking
as
though
he
wished
he
were
n't
)
whilst
her
mother
stood
on
the
hearth-rug
,
arms
folded
and
wearing
a
furious
expression
.
Sally
began
to
tremble
in
earnest
.
"
Well
,
madam
!
"
her
mother
demanded
.
"
What
I
would
like
to
know
is
why
you
saw
fit
to
tell
barefaced
lies
to
your
grandmother
while
your
Dad
and
I
were
on
holiday
.
"
Sally
was
so
surprised
she
could
only
stare
.
"
And
what
a
stupid
lie
too
!
"
Grace
went
on
furiously
.
"
Saying

'd
broken
the
heel
on

shoe

The
minute
your
gran
told
me
about
it

knew
it
was
n't
true
-
and
so
did
she
,
or
suspected
as
much
,
anyway
.
Why
did
you
do
it
,
Sally
?
You
know
I
wo
n't
have
you
telling
lies

"
"
I
-
well

Paula

me
to

Sally
said
miserably
.
"
Oh
yes

up
a
story
like
that

did

told

it

she
wagged
a
finger
to
silence
Sally
's
protest
,
"

do
n't
want

Sally
went
,
relieved
at
not
having
had
her
love
bite
spotted
but
filled
with
indignation
at
having
been
blamed
so
unjustly
for
the
Gran
Bristow
episode

Paula
was
already
in
bed
,
reading
a
paper
novelette

Sally
cried

"

"
There
was
a
loud
bang
on
the
door
and
Grace
's
angry
voice
called
:
"
And
you
can
stop
that
quarrelling

the

Sally
hissed
under
her
breath
.
"
Keep
quiet

Sally
,

heard
what
Mum
said

"
"

I
'll

Never

"
But
even
as
she
seethed
she
knew
it
was
not
true
.
By
this
time
tomorrow
the
whole
thing
would
be
forgotten
and
she
would
have
forgiven
Paula
.
Paula
could
not
help
herself
.
It
was
just
the
way
she
was
.
Others
might
say
they
hated
her
and
mean
it
.
Sally
never
would
.
Whatever
Paula
did
,
however
mean
and
underhand
,
however
selfish
,
in
the
end
Sally
would
find
an
excuse
for
her
.
Was
n't
that
what
sisters
were
for
?
Ever
since
she
had
left
school
Paula
had
worked
in
one
of
the
big
department
stores
in
Bristol
and
she
loved
it
,
although
the
lengthy
journey
made
for
very
long
days
and
the
bus
fares
ate
holes
in
her
meagre
salary
.
But
to
Paula
Ladies
'
Fashions
was
a
veritable
Aladdin
's
cave
of
delights
.
She
loved
the
rails
of
beautiful
clothes
-
the
tailored
suits
and
the
beaded
evening
dresses
,
the
taffeta
and
lace
and
wool
baratheas
and
most
of
all
the
furs
,
and
when
she
could
she
would
slip
into
one
of
the
changing
rooms
and
try
things
on
.
Because
she
was
so
tall
and
slim
all
the
clothes
looked
marvellous
on
her
and
the
other
girls
would
groan
their
envy
.
It
simply
was
not
fair
that
anyone
could
look
so
good
in
absolutely
everything
!
Paula
disagreed
.
The
greatest
unfairness
,
she
thought
,
was
that
the
women
who
could
afford
to
buy
the
beautiful
clothes
simply
did
not
do
them
justice
,
while
she
,
who
showed
them
off
so
well
,
had
to
save
for
weeks
,
even
given
her
staff
discount
,
for
the
most
modestly
priced
item
.
All
too
often
she
had
to
watch
the
garment
she
had
set
her
heart
on
disappear
out
of
the
store
inside
one
of
the
giant
shiny
carrier
bags
with
rope
handles
.
One
day
,
she
promised
herself
,
she
would
be
rich
enough
to
buy
whatever
she
wanted
-
not
only
clothes
but
jewellery
and
perfume
,
real
leather
shoes
and
the
very
best
cosmetics
-

Jenkinsons
,
the
department
store
,
occupied
a
grand
old
building
in
the
heart
of
Bristol
and
a
good
third
of
the
top
floor
was
taken
up
by
a
restaurant
-
The
Palm
Court
.
Genteel
and
restful
with
lace
cloths
on
the
little
tables
,
parlour
palms
in
pots
around
what
might
almost
have
been
a
dais
for
a
three-piece
orchestra
,
and
table
service
by
waitresses
in
neat
black
dresses
and
white
lace
caps
and
aprons
,
the
Palm
Court
was
invariably
at
its
busiest
with
morning
coffees
and
afternoon
teas
when
shoppers
were
tempted
with
an
array
of
dainty
cakes
and
pastries
and
hot
toasted
teacakes
in
silver
dishes
complete
with
lids
.
The
clientele
made
a
perfect
captive
audience
and
in
the
early
autumn
of
Paula
's
second
year
at
the
store
the
management
decided
to
bring
in
models
to
show
the
new
season
's
fashions
at
the
times
when
the
restaurant
was
most
likely
to
be
full
of
ladies
who
had
accounts
with
Jenkinsons
and
cheque
books
in
their
capacious
handbags
.
A
local
model
agency
provided
the
girls
for
the
twice-weekly
shows
and
Paula
was
detailed
to
help
"
backstage
"
.
When
the
three
girls
arrived
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
in
spite
of
their
sophistication
they
were
not
much
older
than
she
was
and
as
she
watched
them
glide
out
in
the
first
selection
of
fashions
she
felt
a
small
prickle
of
excitement
.
If
they
could
do
it
-
why
should
n't
she
?
She
was
as
tall
as
they
were
,
she
wore
the
clothes
just
as
well
and
she
was
just
as
pretty
,
if
not
prettier
.
Whilst
dressing
the
models
she
tried
to
chat
to
them
and
ask
how
they
had
come
by
their
jobs
but
they
were
not
very
forthcoming
.
It
was
as
if
they
considered
themselves
above
socialising
with
a
mere
shop
assistant
.
Paula
was
annoyed
but
not
subdued
.
Her
own
self-confidence
made
her
impervious
to
the
intended
snubs
.
One
morning
as
she
was
rushing
back
to
the
changing
rooms
one
of
the
models
slipped
and
twisted
her
ankle
.
As
she
hobbled
and
hopped
in
agony
Mrs
Freer
,
the
Fashion
Buyer
,
fumed
.
"
We
have
n't
shown
the
cornflower
blue
yet
and
I
particularly
wanted
it
to
have
an
airing
.
At
the
price
it
is
,
the
sooner
I
can
find
a
buyer
for
it
the
happier
I
'll
be
.
"
Paula
,
who
was
zipping
one
of
the
other
models
into
a
cocktail
dress
,
felt
her
skin
begin
to
prick
with
excitement
.
"
Let
me
wear
it
,
Mrs
Freer
!
"
she
suggested
.
"
It
fits
me
.
And
I
could
model
,
I
know
I
could
!
"
The
other
girls
looked
at
her
with
dislike
but
Paula
ignored
them
.
"
Very
well
,
"
Mrs
Freer
said
after
a
moment
's
consideration
.
"
Try
it
on
.
Hmm
.
It
does
look
good
on
you
.
But
you
'll
need
a
little
more
eye
shadow
-
blue
to
bring
out
the
colour
of
the
suit
.
And
will
the
hat
sit
right
on
your
hair
?
"
On
the
shop
floor
Paula
wore
her
hair
in
a
French
pleat
.
Now
she
let
it
down
and
tied
it
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
with
a
scarf
.
Above
it
,
the
hat
sat
perfectly
.
A
touch
more
eyeshadow
and
mascara
and
she
twirled
for
Mrs
Freer
.
"
Will
I
do
?
"
"
Yes
.
Now
take
your
time
,
wo
n't
you
?
Do
n't
rush
.
Give
the
customers
plenty
of
opportunity
to
see
you
from
all
angles
and
let
them
feel
the
cloth
if
they
want
to
.
And
do
n't
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
bump
into
a
table
or
one
of
the
waitresses
-
"
"
I
know
,
"
Paula
said
impatiently
.
Had
n't
she
been
watching
the
models
for
weeks
and
dying
for
a
chance
to
imitate
them
?
As
she
walked
onto
the
floor
her
heart
was
beating
fast
with
excitement
but
her
face
was
a
smiling
serene
mask
.
She
moved
with
natural
grace
,
gliding
between
the
tables
,
approaching
customers
who
showed
an
interest
to
give
them
an
extra
twirl
,
unbuttoning
the
little
figure-hugging
jacket
and
posing
with
her
hand
on
her
waist
,
rucking
up
the
jacket
slightly
to
display
the
blouse
underneath
as
she
had
seen
the
professional
models
do
.
She
was
enjoying
herself
so
much
that
she
stayed
on
the
floor
longer
than
she
should
have
done
and
it
was
only
when
she
saw
Mrs
Freer
making
furious
faces
at
her
from
the
doorway
that
she
turned
and
glided
back
.
She
felt
as
if
she
were
floating
on
air
.
"
Over
exposure
wo
n't
help
one
bit
!
"
Mrs
Freer
hissed
as
she
passed
her
and
in
the
dressing
room
the
other
models
pointedly
turned
their
backs
on
her
,
annoyed
that
an
untrained
shop
girl
should
have
been
allowed
to
trespass
in
their
territory
.
But
to
Paula
's
triumphant
delight
the
suit
was
snapped
up
the
moment
it
went
back
onto
its
hanger
-
a
solicitor
's
wife
who
had
stopped
for
a
coffee
had
fallen
in
love
with
it
,
even
if
the
skirt
did
have
to
be
taken
up
four
full
inches
to
make
it
fit
her
less-than-willow
tall
frame
.
"
You
did
quite
well
,
"
Mrs
Freer
admitted
grudgingly
,
then
spoiled
it
by
adding
:
"
Do
n't
let
it
go
to
your
head
.
"
The
remark
was
lost
on
Paula
.
She
knew
now
without
a
moment
's
doubt
exactly
what
she
was
going
to
do
.
On
her
very
next
day
off
Paula
made
herself
up
carefully
,
put
on
her
smartest
suit
-
a
cheap
version
of
the
one
she
had
shown
in
the
restaurant
-
and
caught
a
bus
to
Bristol
.
The
model
agency
office
was
in
a
tall
old
house
in
Clifton
and
Paula
splashed
out
some
of
her
savings
on
a
taxi
so
that
she
could
at
least
arrive
in
style
.
Her
stomach
was
turning
nervous
somersaults
as
she
rang
the
bell
but
she
was
determined
no
one
should
realise
it
.
Arlene
Frampton-Cox
,
who
ran
the
agency
,
had
once
been
a
model
herself
-
and
it
showed
.
She
was
tall
and
beautifully
groomed
with
iron-grey
hair
,
a
smooth
,
high-cheekboned
face
and
a
most
intimidating
manner
.
When
Paula
was
shown
into
her
office
Arlene
looked
up
from
a
sheaf
of
photographs
which
were
spread
on
her
desk
with
just
a
hint
of
impatience
.
"
Yes
?
"
"
I
want
to
be
a
model
,
"
Paula
said
directly
.
"
Could
you
take
me
onto
your
books
?
"
Arlene
looked
her
up
and
down
with
a
practised
eye
.
Although
she
gave
no
hint
of
it
,
she
liked
what
she
saw
.
"
What
training
have
you
had
?
"
she
enquired
.
"
I
have
n't
,
"
Paula
admitted
.
"
But
I
did
stand
in
for
one
of
your
girls
at
Jenkinsons
last
week
-
and
I
sold
the
suit
I
showed
.
"
Arlene
's
scarlet
lips
tightened
a
shade
.
She
did
not
approve
of
amateurs
,
especially
amateurs
who
thought
they
could
step
into
the
shoes
of
professional
models
.
"
I
'm
sorry
but
I
'm
afraid
there
is
no
way
I
could
take
an
untrained
girl
onto
my
books
.
Though
it
may
look
easy
there
is
a
right
way
to
walk
,
to
sit
,
to
turn
,
to
remove
a
coat
.
"
Paula
's
heart
sank
.
She
had
thought
she
knew
how
to
do
these
things
but
this
imposing
woman
was
making
her
feel
very
gauche
,
very
uncomfortable
.
Arlene
's
mouth
twitched
slightly
but
Paula
did
not
notice
it
.
"
Of
course

you
wish
to
learn
I
do
run
classes
in
the
art

she
continued
smoothly
.
"
Twelve

adept
eight

use

at
the
Grand

a
Tuesday

Paula
asked
.

enough

would

steely-grey
eyes
ran
over

again

shortly

,
I
'm
going
to
do
it
,
"
Paula
said
and
Grace
shook
her
head
resignedly
.
Paula
might
look
as
if
butter
would
n't
melt
in
her
mouth
but
when
her
mind
was
made
up
to
something
it
took
a
stronger
woman
than
Grace
to
talk
her
out
of
it
.
It
had
always
been
the
same
,
ever
since
she
was
a
little
girl
.
"
Well
I
hope
you
'll
look
out
for
yourself
and
remember
how
we
've
brought
you
up
"
,
Grace
warned
.
Paula
smiled
,
all
sunshine
now
she
had
her
own
way
,
and
treated
her
mother
to
a
hug
that
was
enthusiastic
yet
somehow
oddly
impersonal
.
"
I
will
.
And
when
I
'm
famous
you
'll
be
proud
of
me
,
"
she
promised
.
After
only
eight
lessons
Arlene
asked
Paula
to
wait
at
the
end
of
class
.
"
If
you
're
interested
I
have
a
job
for
you
,
"
she
said
shortly
.
"
Really
?
"
Paula
's
heart
leaped
.
"
You
mean
you
think
I
'm
good
enough
?
"
she
asked
tentatively
.
She
had
enjoyed
the
classes
but
the
first
thing
they
had
taught
her
was
how
much
she
did
not
know
,
denting
her
confidence
somewhat
,
and
she
was
still
terrified
of
the
daunting
Mrs
Frampton-Cox
.
"
You
've
done
quite
well
,
"
Arlene
conceded
,
keeping
to
herself
the
growing
excitement
with
which
she
had
been
watching
Paula
over
the
past
weeks
.
The
girl
had
something
-
quite
apart
from
her
natural
grace
and
outstanding
good
looks
,
quite
apart
from
the
lithe
,
leggy
body
that
was
simply
made
for
modelling
,
there
was
a
quality
about
her
that
made
her
stand
out
from
all
the
others
girls
in
the
class
,
which
drew
the
eye
and
held
it
,
so
that
even
someone
as
cynical
as
Arlene
looked
and
wanted
to
go
on
looking
.
Sometimes
,
in
fact
,
she
had
felt
she
was
in
danger
of
neglecting
the
rest
of
her
pupils
for
though
her
voice
continued
to
drone
on
,
snapping
out
an
instruction
here
,
a
correction
there
,
she
was
in
reality
watching
Paula
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
and
experiencing
the
same
excitement
of
discovery
that
she
had
felt
on
the
day
when
Paula
had
first
walked
into
her
office
.
The
girl
could
be
a
top
model
,
not
a
doubt
of
it
.
She
needed
a
little
experience
here
in
the
provinces
first
,
of
course
,
just
enough
to
give
her
finesse
and
confidence
,
not
too
much
so
that
she
became
jaded
,
and
then
-
I
can
get
her
work
in
London
-
I
know
it
!
Arlene
thought
,
barely
able
to
conceal
her
jubilation
.
Anyone
would
be
delighted
to
have
her
,
maybe
even
the
top
couture
houses
.
The
thought
was
a
heady
one
.
Though
she
had
been
quite
a
successful
model
herself
Arlene
had
never
reached
those
giddy
heights
-
the
thought
that
now
a
pupil
and
protege
of
hers
might
achieve
it
made
her
prickle
with
excitement
.
She
glanced
at
the
girl
standing
eagerly
in
front
of
her
.
"
It
's
a
fashion
show
for
charity
,
"
she
explained
.
"
Two
of
the
big
stores
in
town
are
getting
together
to
put
it
on
.
There
will
be
two
rehearsals
,
one
on
the
previous
Saturday
,
one
on
the
afternoon
of
the
show
.
I
shall
expect
you
to
be
there
promptly
,
with
a
selection
of
shoes
.
The
stores
will
provide
the
jewellery
and
accessories
.
The
show
is
on
the
Thursday
evening
,
by
the
way
.
Can
you
do
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
!
"
Paula
breathed
.
Already
her
mind
was
busy
with
the
practical
problems
-
did
she
have
the
right
shoes
and
if
not
how
could
she
afford
to
buy
them
.
And
Thursday
was
not
one
of
her
days
off
-
how
could
she
be
free
in
the
afternoon
?
But
somehow
she
would
manage
it
.
She
'd
beg
,
borrow
or
steal
the
money
for
the
shoes
,
and
if
she
was
given
notice
at
the
store
when
she
insisted
on
having
the
afternoon
off
,
well
,
so
be
it
.
Modelling
was
going
to
be
her
career
from
now
on
.
And
she
was
going
to
make
sure
that
nothing
stood
in
her
way
!
Edward
had
a
car
-
an
ancient
but
still
magnificent-looking
Ford
Zephyr
.
When
Sally
got
off
the
bus
he
was
waiting
for
her
,
leaning
against
the
bonnet
,
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
more
than
ever
the
dashing
young
man-about-town
.
"
Well
,
what
do
you
think
?
"
he
asked
her
.
"
It
's
beautiful
!
"
she
gasped
,
much
impressed
.
"
I
thought
we
'd
go
for
a
drive
and
put
her
through
her
paces
,
"
he
suggested
.
Sally
agreed
readily
.
To
go
for
a
drive
in
a
boyfriend
's
car
seemed
the
height
of
sophistication
.
She
only
wished
there
was
someone
who
knew
her
to
see
her
climbing
in
.
The
car
had
a
bench
seat
in
the
front
and
smelled
of
warm
leather
and
old
cigarette
smoke
.
Edward
took
her
on
a
tour
of
Bath
-
perhaps
he
was
also
hoping
to
be
seen
by
someone
who
knew
him
!
-
and
then
headed
out
into
the
country
.
It
was
a
fine
warm
autumn
evening
and
although
the
light
was
already
dying
out
of
the
sky
the
trees
still
looked
magnificent
,
shades
of
gold
and
red
blending
with
some
still-green
foliage
.
As
they
bowled
along
the
country
roads
Sally
sat
erect
on
the
bench-seat
feeling
like
a
queen
.
After
about
an
hour
's
driving
Edward
pulled
onto
the
forecourt
of
a
country
pub
.
"
This
is
supposed
to
be
a
nice
place
,
"
he
said
.
"
All
the
best
pubs
are
out
of
town
.
"
The
pub
was
picturesque
and
cosy
with
beams
laden
with
gleaming
horse-brasses
,
farm
implements
on
the
walls
and
a
huge
inglenook
fireplace
.
They
found
a
wooden
bench
seat
in
a
corner
and
squeezed
into
it
with
their
drinks
-
Edward
had
a
pint
of
bitter
and
Sally
a
Babycham
in
a
pretty
glass
decorated
with
a
dancing
fawn
in
a
blue
neck-bow
.
Edward
put
his
arm
around
Sally
and
little
prickles
of
excitement
started
deep
inside
her
.
She
sat
quite
still
enjoying
them
.
Why
did
n't
they
last
when
Edward
tried
to
go
further
,
she
wondered
?
When
she
thought
about
the
things
he
did
they
became
even
sharper
,
so
that
it
felt
as
if
an
electric
shock
was
passing
right
through
the
centre
of
her
body
.
But
the
reality
was
different
.
All
the
lovely
prickles
and
twists
stopped
and
she
was
left
with
nothing
but
a
feeling
of
panic
,
able
to
think
of
nothing
but
how
could
she
stop
him
without
making
him
angry
.
And
afterwards
there
was
just
a
feeling
of
let-down
,
of
wanting
him
to
hold
her
and
kiss
her
and
pet
her
like
a
little
girl
.
No
-
pet
was
the
wrong
word
.
Petting
meant
doing
that
so
no
,
she
certainly
did
not
want
to
be
petted
and
much
less
to
pet
Edward
.
Perhaps
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
,
Sally
thought
glumly
.
"
This
is
the
life
?
"
Edward
said
,
squeezing
her
gently
.
"
What
a
day
!
"
"
We
had
some
excitement
at
home
yesterday
,
"
Sally
offered
.
"
My
sister
is
going
to
model
in
a
charity
show
.
I
told
you
she
was
taking
classes
,
did
n't
I
?
"
"
Yes
,
you
said
.
"
Naturally
Sally
talked
about
Paula
.
For
one
thing
she
was
very
proud
of
her
,
for
another
when
she
talked
about
her
lovely
sister
and
her
exciting
life
she
felt
as
if
some
of
the
glamour
rubbed
off
onto
her
.
But
Edward
had
never
met
Paula
.
"
Sounds
as
if
she
's
doing
well
,
"
Edward
said
.
"
I
know
.
She
's
only
done
half
the
course
and
already
she
has
been
picked
out
for
this
job
.
I
think
she
's
going
to
go
a
long
way
-
which
she
deserves
to
.
"
Sally
speared
the
cherry
which
was
floating
in
her
Babycham
and
popped
it
into
her
mouth
.
"
Where
is
the
show
?
"
Edward
asked
.
"
Bristol
.
Why
?
"
"
Do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
go
along
and
support
her
?
"
Sally
was
so
surprised
she
almost
choked
on
her
cherry
.
She
did
not
think
men
were
interested
in
fashion
.
"
Now
that
I
've
got
the
car
we
can
do
things
like
that
,
"
Edward
went
on
.
"
We
could
take
your
sister
home
afterwards
-
if
she
wants
a
lift
,
that
is
.
"
"
So
we
could
,
"
Sally
said
,
pleased
.
The
thought
that
she
was
the
one
with
a
boyfriend
with
a
car
made
her
feel
very
important
-
one
up
on
Paula
for
a
change
!
They
finished
their
drinks
and
left
.
It
was
completely
dark
by
now
,
a
black
velvety
night
sprinkled
with
stars
.
Sally
sat
close
to
Edward
on
the
bench
seat
and
he
drove
with
one
arm
around
her
,
somehow
managing
to
change
gear
with
his
right
hand
.
When
they
were
almost
home
Edward
pulled
into
a
farm
gateway
and
turned
off
the
engine
.
He
pulled
Sally
close
,
kissing
her
,
and
she
wound
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
enjoying
the
first
little
prickles
of
yearning
.
All
too
soon
however
his
hands
began
their
usual
wandering
,
slipping
inside
her
blouse
to
unclip
her
bra
hooks
,
pushing
her
skirt
well
up
her
thighs
and
trying
to
slip
her
panties
off
.
Sally
sat
down
hard
on
them
,
forcing
her
legs
together
,
but
as
usual
in
the
end
he
won
and
she
retrieved
the
panties
from
the
floor
,
pushing
them
behind
her
on
the
seat
before
they
were
trampled
underfoot
.
"
Let's
get
in
the
back
.
It
would
be
much
more
comfortable
,
"
Edward
suggested
.
"
No
!
"
Sally
said
,
realising
the
dangers
of
the
back
seat
.
"
We
ought
to
be
getting
home
.
Mum
will
be
expecting
me
to
be
on
the
bus
,
remember
.
"
Edward
ignored
her
protest
,
somehow
contorting
himself
so
that
he
could
kiss
her
breasts
,
bare
now
,
since
her
bra
was
around
her
waist
,
and
still
keep
his
hand
between
her
legs
beneath
the
rucked-up
skirt
.
Something
about
the
feel
of
his
lips
tugging
at
her
nipples
began
to
excite
Sally
and
though
she
still
felt
nothing
but
discomfort
from
his
probing
finger
she
relaxed
a
little
,
leaning
her
head
back
into
the
corner
provided
by
the
bench
seat
and
the
window
.
It
really
was
a
rather
pleasant
sensation
.
Edward
contorted
again
,
biting
first
at
her
throat
and
then
kissing
her
full
on
the
mouth
,
forcing
her
lips
apart
with
his
tongue
.
Sally
could
taste
the
cigarettes
and
beer
and
found
that
that
too
was
exciting
.
Then
somehow
she
was
spreadeagled
along
the
seat
and
he
was
half-kneeling
,
half
-lying
on
top
of
her
and
suddenly
she
did
not
think
that
what
was
between
her
legs
was
his
finger
.
It
was
less
sharp
,
bigger
,
hotter
and
instead
of
scratching
painfully
it
felt
good
.
Carefully
Sally
moved
against
it
and
felt
a
sort
of
yearning
begin
in
the
sensitised
area
between
her
thighs
.
She
moved
again
experimentally
.
It
was
nice
-
oooh
,
really
nice
.
Edward
was
still
kissing
her
,
his
tongue
circling
inside
her
mouth
,
but
all
she
could
think
about
was
this
new
sensation
between
her
legs
,
a
little
like
the
way
she
felt
when
they
danced
,
but
even
better
.
"
Oh
,
Sally
!

whispered
,
his
breath
ragged
.
Then
suddenly
he
lunged
and
the
pleasant
sensation
was
gone
,
replaced
not
by
pain
but
by
a
strange
,
full
feeling
and
Sally
began
to
feel
frightened
again
.
She
wanted
him
to
stop
yet
at
the
same
time
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
hope
that
the
lovely
sensations
would
begin
again
.
She
was
also
dimly
aware
that
they
had
passed
the
point
of
no
return
-
now
she
had
allowed
him
inside
her
it
seemed
wrong
to
yell
at
him
to
stop
or
begin
fighting
him
.
After
a
few
thrusting
minutes
Edward
gave
a
strangled
cry
that
seemed
to
come
from
deep
in
his
throat
and
jerked
out
of
her
.
He
sprawled
back
behind
the
steering
wheel
,
eyes
closed
,
breathing
heavily
and
clutching
a
handkerchief
to
himself
.
Sally
lay
without
moving
,
looking
at
him
in
the
light
of
the
moon
.
She
felt
stunned
,
as
if
what
he
had
done
to
her
had
somehow
paralysed
not
only
her
limbs
but
her
senses
too
,
leaving
her
tense
.
There
was
no
satisfaction
,
no
pleasure
,
just
a
kind
of
aching
emptiness
.
Then
suddenly
she
became
aware
of
how
inelegant
she
must
look
,
sprawled
there
with
her
skirt
up
around
her
hips
and
her
bra
dangling
out
of
her
open
blouse
.
She
sat
up
,
straightening
her
clothes
just
as
Edward
opened
the
steamed-up
window
of
the
car
and
dumped
the
handkerchief
out
into
the
hedge
.
"
You
wo
n't
have
any
hankies
left
as
this
rate
,
"
she
said
,
then
giggled
with
embarrassment
.
What
a
stupid
thing
to
have
said
!
"
Who
cares
?
"
Edward
asked
grandly
.
He
reached
for
her
to
kiss
her
again
and
Sally
clung
to
him
hoping
that
somehow
the
contact
would
make
everything
come
right
.
But
after
a
minute
he
put
her
away
and
started
the
engine
.
"
I
'd
better
get
you
home
,
"
he
said
.
Sally
felt
like
crying
again
.
There
must
be
something
wrong
with
her
.
They
'd
gone
all
the
way
and
still
she
did
n't
feel
any
of
the
things
one
was
supposed
to
feel
-
elated
,
contented
,
together
.
Now
that
it
was
over
Edward
seemed
to
have
gone
a
very
long
way
away
from
her
,
as
if
she
was
no
more
than
a
stranger
to
whom
he
was
giving
a
lift
.
For
the
remainder
of
the
journey
she
fiddled
with
her
clothes
,
trying
to
make
sure
she
would
look
respectable
when
she
arrived
home
and
arranging
the
neck
of
her
blouse
to
cover
her
throat
where
she
was
sure
she
must
have
another
love
bite
.
"
See
you
on
Saturday
-
same
place
?
"
Edward
said
as
he
stopped
the
car
outside
her
house
.
Sally
nodded
,
the
feeling
of
let-down
growing
.
She
had
hoped
he
might
arrange
to
come
and
collect
her
now
that
he
had
the
car
-
and
now
that
things
were
,
well
,
serious
between
them
.
But
she
did
n't
like
to
suggest
it
.
As
she
slammed
the
car
door
she
saw
curtains
at
lighted
windows
twitching
up
and
down
the
road
.
Well
,
at
least
he
'd
brought
her
home
.
At
least
the
neighbours
would
know
she
had
a
boyfriend
with
a
car
.
Walking
up
the
path
to
the
front
door
on
legs
that
felt
slightly
wobbly
Sally
realised
she
would
have
to
be
satisfied
with
that
.
Sally
and
Edward
sat
in
the
very
front
row
of
the
audience
at
the
Fashion
Show
on
canvas
hospital-style
chairs
.
Two
feet
in
front
of
them
was
the
catwalk
,
a
bare
narrow
wooden
platform
angling
away
from
a
curtained
entrance
.
Sally
stared
at
the
curtains
wondering
what
was
going
on
behind
them
.
Chaos
,
probably
.
Paula
had
told
her
there
were
twelve
models
in
the
show
and
each
of
them
had
to
wear
at
least
ten
outfits
.
One
hundred
and
twenty
outfits
,
not
to
mention
all
the
shoes
and
hats
and
gloves
.
How
on
earth
did
they
keep
track
of
them
all
?
When
she
was
dressing
to
go
out
Sally
was
invariably
unable
to
find
the
belt
she
wanted
,
one
shoe
had
gone
missing
or
one
stocking
developed
a
ladder
.
But
one
hundred
and
twenty
outfits
-
what
a
nightmare
!
She
glanced
around
at
the
audience
who
were
appearing
in
twos
and
threes
.
Mostly
they
were
very
smart
women
in
suits
and
soft
draped
dresses
.
Sally
had
agonised
over
what
to
wear
-
she
was
so
afraid
of
letting
Paula
down
-
but
eventually
she
had
settled
on
a
neat
shirt-waister
blouse
and
pencil
skirt
and
Paula
had
loaned
her
a
poplin
duster
coat
in
duck-egg
blue
with
a
thick
soft
grey
Lucca
Lamb
collar
.
Sally
felt
good
in
it
-
the
fur
was
gorgeously
soft
when
she
buried
her
chin
in
it
and
she
thought
that
at
least
she
could
hold
her
own
in
the
midst
of
all
this
elegance
.
The
background
music
stopped
and
was
replaced
by
an
expectant
hum
,
then
that
too
ceased
as
the
curtains
parted
and
a
man
in
a
dinner
jacket
and
black
bow
tie
stepped
out
onto
the
catwalk
.
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
-
welcome
!
"
he
boomed
.
His
microphone
whistled
a
little
and
Sally
winced
in
embarrassment
.
The
first
model
appeared
on
the
catwalk
,
looking
so
glamorous
,
so
unbelievably
chic
,
that
Sally
could
scarcely
believe
that
her
very
own
sister
could
be
a
part
of
this
glittering
performance
.
But
a
few
moments
later
there
she
was
-
tall
and
beautiful
in
a
little
green
boucle
dress
with
matching
jacket
.
"
It
's
her
-
it
's
Paula
!
"
Sally
hissed
,
almost
falling
off
her
chair
in
excitement
.
"
That
is
?
"
Edward
whispered
back
,
stunned
.
"
Yes
,
does
n't
she
look
marvellous
?
"
Someone
behind
them
coughed
pointedly
and
they
went
quiet
but
Sally
was
wishing
she
could
shout
to
the
whole
room
:
"
That
's
my
sister
!
"
She
was
so
proud
she
thought
she
would
burst
.
And
so
happy
and
excited
that
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
worry
about
the
devastating
effect
Paula
was
having
on
Edward
.
Behind
the
scenes
Paula
slipped
out
of
one
outfit
,
letting
it
fall
to
the
floor
,
and
reached
for
the
next
,
hanging
in
the
correct
order
on
her
clothes
rail
.
The
girl
who
was
dressing
her
pulled
up
the
zipper
while
Paula
kicked
off
a
pair
of
black
suede
shoes
and
eased
her
feet
into
crocodile
ones
.
A
quick
flick
of
a
comb
through
her
hair
-
there
was
no
hat
to
accessorise
this
dress
-
she
reached
for
the
crocodile
clutch
bag
and
moved
towards
the
doorway
for
Arlene
to
give
her
a
quick
check
before
she
stepped
out
onto
the
catwalk
again
.
She
felt
alive
as
never
before
,
and
her
eyes
were
glittering
with
excitement
.
Her
initial
nerves
had
all
gone
now
although
it
still
felt
strange
to
be
on
a
catwalk
rather
than
the
carpeted
floor
of
the
room
at
the
Grand
Hotel
.
Arlene
gave
her
a
small
push
to
indicate
it
was
time
and
she
moved
out
.
She
could
n't
wait
to
be
back
under
the
lights
again
with
all
eyes
on
her
.
As
she
sashayed
down
the
catwalk
she
caught
sight
of
Sally
and
Edward
.
The
first
time
out
she
had
seen
nothing
but
a
sea
of
faces
,
so
hard
had
she
been
concentrating
on
what
she
was
doing
.
Now
she
let
her
eyes
dwell
on
them
for
a
moment
-
Sally
glowing
with
pride
,
Edward
with
a
slightly
dazed
expression
on
his
handsome
face
.
Not
bad
!
Paula
thought
.
Not
bad
at
all
.
You
have
quite
a
catch
there
,
little
sister
.
She
did
not
dare
look
at
them
for
too
long
for
fear
of
missing
her
footing
or
forgetting
a
move
but
the
look
on
Edward
's
face
added
another
notch
to
her
enjoyment
.
She
twirled
slowly
,
feeling
his
eyes
on
her
so
that
it
was
as
though
she
was
receiving
an
injection
of
adrenalin
.
Oh
how
she
was
enjoying
herself
!
She
wanted
it
to
go
on
for
ever
and
ever
!
She
was
back
at
the
curtains
again
.
Time
to
turn
,
hold
one
last
pose
,
then
move
out
.
But
there
were
still
eight
outfits
to
go
.
Paula
intended
to
make
the
most
of
every
one
of
them
.
"
Well
,
did
you
enjoy
it
?
"
"
Oh
yes
!
Paula
,
you
were
wonderful
!
"
The
show
was
over
,
the
audience
had
drifted
away
to
a
reception
room
where
they
would
be
further
wooed
with
a
glass
of
champagne
and
a
selection
of
canapes
and
nibbles
and
Paula
,
dressed
now
in
one
of
her
own
suits
,
smart
black
barathea
,
had
emerged
from
the
dressing
rooms
to
meet
the
waiting
Sally
and
Edward
.
She
was
still
on
a
"
high
"
,
the
potent
adrenalin
pumping
through
her
veins
,
eyes
sparkling
,
cheeks
glowing
with
a
becoming
flush
that
owed
nothing
to
the
skilfully
applied
make-up
.
"
Did
you
see
anything
you
'd
like
to
buy
?
"
"
Oh
yes
-
everything
!
But
you
know
very
well
I
ca
n't

And
anyway
,
it
was
you
we
came
to
see
.
"
"
You
were
n't
supposed
to
be
looking
at
me
.
You
were
supposed
to
be
looking
at
the
clothes
,
"
Paula
said
artlessly
.
She
was
watching
Edward
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
Yes
,
he
was
every
bit
as
good
looking
as
she
had
thought
he
was
when
she
had
glimpsed
him
from
the
catwalk
.
And
he
owned
a
car
!
Not
bad
at
all
.
He
was
only
an
office
worker
,
of
course
,
a
clerk
of
sorts
,
Sally
had
said
,
not
quite
in
the
class
that
Paula
intended
to
aim
at
,
but
very
presentable
for
all
that
.
And
to
think
he
was
going
out
with
Sally
!
The
fact
was
somehow
offensive
to
Paula
's
ego
.
In
that
moment
she
made
up
her
mind
.
She
did
n't
really
want
him
,
of
course
but
she
simply
had
to
prove
to
herself
that
he
would
prefer
her
to
Sally
,
given
the
choice
.
She
smiled
at
him
and
felt
his
quickening
interest
.
It
was
so
easy
,
so
incredibly
easy
.
What
was
the
expression
?
"
Taking
candy
from
a
baby
.
"
It
summed
up
the
situation
perfectly
.
"
Did
Sally
say
you
might
be
able
to
squeeze
me
into
your
car
?
"
she
asked
,
fluttering
her
eyelashes
.
"
Hardly
squeeze
,
"
Sally
began
,
embarrassed
,
then
broke
off
.
Edward
was
not
listening
.
Neither
of
them
were
.
Edward
was
staring
at
Paula
and
Sally
did
not
like
the
expression
on
his
face
.
She
felt
the
pit
of
her
stomach
fall
away
.
"
It
's
a
big
car
,
"
she
finished
lamely
.
"
Are
you
sure
I
'm
not
making
a
nuisance
of
myself
?
"
Paula
gushed
.
"
Of
course
not
.
I
have
to
drive
Sally
home
anyway
.
"
The
way
he
said
it
made
Sally
feel
like
a
parcel
for
delivery
.
"
I
wo
n't
be
long
.
I
'll
just
get
my
things

"
Paula
disappeared
through
the
swing
doors
.
Edward
gazed
after
her
.
There
was
a
glow
about
him
that
all
men
had
when
they
were
around
Paula
.
Sally
felt
sick
.
"
What
are
we
going
to
do
on
Saturday
?
"
she
asked
,
catching
at
his
arm
,
desperate
for
reassurance
.
"
Hmm
?
Oh
-
I
do
n't
know
.
Where
does
your
sister
go
?
Perhaps
we
could
make
up
a
party
.
That
would
be
fun
.
"
For
you
,
maybe
,
not
for
me
!
Sally
thought
.
Paula
reappeared
,
carrying
the
little
modelling
case
she
had
had
to
buy
and
equip
with
cosmetics
,
shoes
and
spare
tights
.
"
I
was
just
saying
to
Sally
,
why
do
n't
you
come
out
with
us
on
Saturday
?
"
Edward
suggested
.
"
We
could
go
as
a
crowd
.
"
"
Oh
what
a
shame
!
I
've
already
made
arrangements
for
this
week
.
"
But
her
eyes
were
flashing
-
nice
try
,
Edward
.
Ask
again
sometime
.
Who
knows
?
"
Are
you
ready
?
"
Sally
asked
.
All
the
shine
had
gone
out
of
the
evening
.
Suddenly
all
she
wanted
to
do
was
get
home
and
bury
her
head
under
her
pillow
.
On
Saturday
Edward
was
late
.
Sally
was
frantic
.
He
had
never
let
her
down
before
.
Suppose
something
had
happened
to
him
?
She
waited
and
waited
,
the
feeling
of
living
a
nightmare
that
had
been
with
her
ever
since
Thursday
intensifying
.
At
last
just
as
she
was
contemplating
getting
the
next
bus
home
he
arrived
.
She
ran
to
meet
him
,
weak
with
relief
,
but
he
was
very
vague
as
to
why
he
was
late
and
there
was
a
remoteness
about
him
that
she
could
not
penetrate
.
Something
was
wrong
she
knew
though
she
could
not
have
said
what
it
was
and
she
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
he
made
some
excuse
about
being
a
bit
busy
next
week
and
unable
to
see
her
.
When
he
stopped
the
car
on
the
way
home
Sally
threw
herself
at
him
.
Tonight
she
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
let
him
do
anything
he
wanted
just
as
long
as
things
would
go
back
to
being
the
way
they
had
been
.
But
Edward
just
did
n't
seem
interested
.
"
When
will
I
see
you
again
?
"
she
asked
desperately
.
"
I
'll
be
in
touch
,
"
he
said
vaguely
and
though
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
would
admit
it
to
herself
Sally
knew
it
was
all
over
.
That
night
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
wondering
where
she
had
gone
wrong
and
thinking
she
could
not
bear
it
if
she
never
saw
Edward
again
.
It
was
probably
because
she
was
always
so
reluctant
to
let
him
make
love
to
her
,
she
decided
.
Everyone
knew
it
was
what
boys
wanted
.
If
only
she
had
been
a
bit
more
accommodating
,
a
bit
more
enthusiastic
.
As
it
was
he
had
obviously
grown
tired
of
the
regular
struggles
and
gone
off
to
find
someone
who
gave
in
more
readily
.
But
in
spite
of
what
had
happened
at
the
fashion
show
she
did
not
think
Paula
had
any
hand
in
it
until
next
day
at
breakfast
.
Paula
,
nibbling
an
Energen
roll
spread
with
reduced-calorie
marmalade
,
said
airily
:
"
Oh
,
who
do
you
think
came
into
the
store
yesterday
?
Your
friend
Edward
!
And
I
think
you
should
know
he
wanted
me
to
go
out
with
him
.
"
Sally
began
to
tremble
.
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
she
asked
.
"
That
I
could
n't
possibly
two-time
you
,
of
course
,
"
Paula
said
,
watching
Sally
slyly
.
"
I
told
him
that
whilst
he
was
dating
my
own
sister
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
.
He
argued
,
of
course
-
said
that
there
was
nothing
serious
between
the
two
of
you
and
you
knew
that
.
But
I
was
adamant
all
the
same
.
"
Her
eyes
narrowed
.
"
You
are
still
going
out
with
him
,
are
n't
you
?
"
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
Sally
said
miserably
.
"
Well
the
rat
!
"
Paula
said
,
but
she
looked
pleased
.
"
You
-
you
would
n't
go
out
with
him
,
would
you
,
Paula
?
"
Sally
asked
,
hating
herself
for
still
wanting
him
.
"
Oh
Sally
,
what
do
you
think
I
am
?
"
Sally
did
not
answer
.
She
did
not
think
Paula
would
have
liked
what
she
had
to
say
.
Edward
never
did
get
in
touch
with
Sally
again
.
She
was
sick
with
wretchedness
,
convinced
she
had
only
herself
to
blame
-
and
of
course
the
devastating
effect
Paula
had
on
men
-
but
still
puzzled
that
it
could
have
ended
so
suddenly
without
a
word
of
explanation
on
his
part
.
Besides
being
heart-broken
she
felt
foolish
and
a
failure
.
But
she
never
did
find
out
if
he
was
successful
in
persuading
Paula
to
go
out
with
him
now
that
he
was
free
.
She
did
not
want
to
know
.
Once
,
months
later
,
when
she
went
to
the
Regency
on
a
Saturday
night
with
some
girlfriends
she
practically
bumped
into
him
on
the
stairs
.
But
he
merely
looked
embarrassed
and
said
:
"
Oh
-
hi
!
"
as
he
passed
as
if
she
was
just
a
casual
acquaintance
.
During
the
evening
she
caught
sight
of
him
a
few
times
,
always
dancing
,
holding
his
partners
very
close
,
and
managing
to
avoid
her
eyes
.
After
that
night
Sally
never
saw
him
again
.
"
I
have
a
very
important
assignment
for
you
,
Paula
,
"
Arlene
Frampton-Cox
said
.
She
inserted
a
Du
Maurier
cigarette
into
her
long
tortoiseshell
holder
and
sat
back
,
looking
at
Paula
,
who
was
seated
in
the
visitor
's
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
,
long
legs
crossed
elegantly
.
Paula
looked
every
inch
a
model
these
days
,
Arlene
thought
with
a
touch
of
proprietorial
pride
.
Her
long
hair
,
shining
gold
,
was
swept
back
and
caught
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
with
a
bow
,
make-up
,
expertly
applied
,
accentuated
the
classically
beautiful
lines
of
her
face
,
and
she
wore
her
well-cut
suit
with
all
the
panache
that
was
expected
of
her
.
A
good
suit
was
a
working
model
's
uniform
-
Paula
now
bought
two
each
season
and
wore
them
with
perfectly
matching
accessories
,
hat
,
bag
and
shoes
.
This
one
was
in
soft
light
green
with
a
boxy
shaped
jacket
and
narrow
skirt
and
the
same
green-and-white
check
material
of
the
little
sleeveless
blouse
had
been
used
to
line
the
jacket
and
face
the
wide
reveres
.
Paula
's
bag
and
shoes
were
patent
black
leather
,
her
gloves
white
,
and
she
carried
a
long
walking
umbrella
neatly
furled
in
its
fur-trimmed
case
.
Perfectly
groomed
from
head
to
toe
and
with
all
that
assurance
,
she
was
ready
to
take
on
the
world
,
Arlene
thought
with
satisfaction
,
for
she
looked
on
Paula
as
her
very
own
creation
.
The
raw
materials
might
have
been
there
before
-
indeed
,
had
n't
it
been
she
,
Arlene
,
who
had
spotted
them
?
But
the
transformation
of
a
leggy
young
filly
into
a
sleekly
beautiful
racehorse
had
been
her
doing
.
eighteen
months
on
the
model
circuit
had
eliminated
all
trace
of
her
former
Somerset
accent
.
She
had
listened
to
Arlene
's
own
voice
and
set
about
imitating
it
for
she
held
her
mentor
in
the
highest
esteem
whilst
still
being
a
little
afraid
of
her
.
The
House
of
Mattli
is
expanding
from
couture
into
ready-to-wear
and
one
of
the
big
Bristol
stores
,
Taylors
,
are
putting
on
a
show
to
publicise
the
fact
that
they
will
be
stocking
the
new
pret-a-porter
'
,
Arlene
explained
.
"
I
have
been
asked
to
supply
the
models
and
I
would
like
you
to
be
one
of
them
.
"
"
Mattli
!
"
Paula
repeated
,
impressed
.
The
House
of
Mattli
was
a
husband
and
wife
team
who
were
numbered
amongst
the
top
ten
names
in
the
Incorporated
Society
of
London
Fashion
Designers
.
Furthermore
Madame
Mattli
was
a
Frenchwoman
,
an
accident
of
birth
which
added
to
her
glamour
,
for
was
not
Paris
the
fashion
capital
of
the
world
?
"
Madame
Mattli
will
be
coming
to
Bristol
herself
,
"
Arlene
continued
.
"
Taylors
have
a
certain
amount
of
stock
but
she
will
be
bringing
extra
samples
from
London
especially
for
the
show
.
I
only
want
the
best
of
my
girls
on
this
job
.
Madame
Mattli
,
remember
,
is
used
to
the
best
.
We
ca
n't
afford
any
sloppiness
.
I
can
count
on
you
,
Paula
,
I
feel
sure
.
"
"
Oh
yes
,
"
Paula
said
,
brimming
with
suppressed
excitement
.
"
You
can
count
on
me
!
"
Madame
Mattli
was
almost
exactly
as
Paula
had
imagined
she
would
be
,
a
petite
perfectly
turned
out
woman
with
an
air
of
chic
that
was
unmistakably
French
.
Her
dark
,
grey-streaked
hair
,
which
she
wore
in
a
long
bob
,
had
been
cut
by
Vidal
Sassoon
and
she
wore
a
beautifully
tailored
black
suit
relieved
only
by
a
little
white
flounce
at
the
neckline
.
In
the
fitting
rooms
at
Taylors
she
fussed
and
fretted
over
her
creations
like
a
mother
hen
and
though
Paula
was
overawed
by
the
great
designer
she
also
liked
her
on
sight
.
Madame
Mattli
might
be
a
stickler
for
detail
,
with
a
generous
helping
of
the
artistic
temperament
which
kept
her
tight-coiled
as
a
spring
and
which
would
explode
into
frenzy
if
the
smallest
detail
was
not
as
it
should
be
,
but
she
also
had
a
kind
face
and
deep
perceptive
eyes
.
Half
way
through
the
day
's
programme
of
shows
,
while
the
dressers
went
off
to
grab
a
sandwich
and
the
model
girls
,
who
would
not
dare
to
eat
while
they
were
showing
,
revived
themselves
with
cups
of
black
coffee
,
Madame
Mattli
took
Paula
to
one
side
.
"
Little
one
,
I
would
like
to
speak
with
you
.
"
Paula
's
stomach
turned
a
somersault
.
Had
she
done
something
wrong
?
"
I
have
been
watching
you
work
,
"
Madame
Mattli
said
directly
.
Her
accent
reminded
Paula
of
Louise
-
perhaps
that
was
why
she
warmed
to
her
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
so
awe-inspiring
.
"
You
are
exactly
right
for
a
couture
model
.
You
have
all
the
physical
attributes
.
"
"
Thank
you
,
"
Paula
said
faintly
.
Madame
Mattli
waved
a
dismissive
hand
.
"
Do
not
thank
me
.
I
am
not
saying
this
to
make
your
head
swell
.
On
the
contrary
.
The
fact
is
that
I
have
a
vacancy
arising
for
a
couture
model
.
I
believe
you
are
exactly
what
I
am
looking
for
.
I
would
like
you
to
come
to
London
to
work
for
me
.
"
Over
Madame
Mattli
's
shoulder
Paula
could
see
Arlene
watching
her
,
a
tiny
smile
lifting
one
corner
of
her
scarlet
mouth
,
and
Paula
knew
her
well
enough
by
now
to
know
exactly
what
she
was
thinking
.
She
did
not
want
to
lose
Paula
,
who
was
one
of
her
best
models
,
but
already
she
was
enjoying
the
reflected
glory
that
came
from
having
personally
trained
a
house
model
for
one
of
the
great
London
couture
houses
.
She
had
known
about
the
vacancy
at
Mattli
and
hoped
that
the
job
might
be
offered
to
Paula
.
It
was
the
seal
of
approval
for
her
own
judgement
.
"
Well
?
"
Madame
Mattli
demanded
.
"
Can
I
have
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
?
"
Paula
asked
boldly
.
"
A
little
.
But
please
do
not
delay
too
long
.
My
present
house
model
leaves
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
there
are
plenty
of
girls
who
would
jump
at
the
chance
.
"
"
I
'm
sure
.
But
all
the
same
I
could
n't
make
such
a
move
without
giving
it
some
thought
,
"
Paula
said
grandly
.
But
inside
she
was
bubbling
with
excitement
.
Time
to
think
?
She
did
n't
need
a
single
second
.
The
moment
Madame
Mattli
had
offered
her
the
job
she
had
made
up
her
mind
.
She
was
going
to
take
it
-
of
course
!
A
month
later
Paula
,
smartly
dressed
in
a
new
tweed
suit
with
the
obligatory
matching
bag
and
shoes
,
and
lugging
both
her
modelling
case
and
a
brand
new
cream
leather
suitcase
,
took
the
train
to
London
to
begin
her
new
career
.
She
had
booked
herself
a
bed
at
a
YWCA
hostel
for
the
time
being
.
It
was
not
quite
what
she
envisaged
for
herself
but
it
had
the
advantage
of
being
cheap
and
it
went
some
way
towards
satisfying
Grace
,
who
was
convinced
that
London
was
a
den
of
iniquity
waiting
to
swallow
up
her
unsuspecting
daughter
.
From
the
hostel
it
was
only
a
short
tube
ride
to
South
Audley
Street
where
Madame
Mattli
had
her
showrooms
-
yet
another
advantage
,
Paula
thought
,
trying
to
weigh
up
the
points
in
favour
of
the
hostel
,
which
she
hated
on
sight
.
Sharing
a
small
spartan
room
with
two
other
girls
-
Northerners
whose
accent
Paula
found
almost
incomprehensible
and
with
whom
she
had
nothing
in
common
,
making
breakfast
in
the
communal
kitchen
,
queuing
for
the
bath
,
adhering
to
a
strict
curfew
after
which
time
the
doors
were
locked
and
bolted
-
none
of
these
were
restrictions
Paula
had
the
slightest
intention
of
enduring
for
long
.
But
for
now
it
would
have
to
do
.
And
at
least
she
was
in
London
,
centre
of
the
British
fashion
industry
.
As
for
the
House
of
Mattli
,
it
might
have
been
in
a
different
world
to
the
hostel
,
with
its
air
of
being
a
cross
between
a
workhouse
and
a
boarding
school
.
The
first
time
she
rang
the
bell
and
went
in
through
the
front
doors
of
the
elegant
old
house
where
the
showrooms
were
situated
(
Mattli
had
no
rear
entrance
)
Paula
felt
she
was
stepping
into
the
place
of
her
dreams
.
Deep
carpet
covered
the
floors
and
the
stairs
swept
up
to
the
showrooms
and
the
warren
of
workrooms
beyond
,
and
though
the
window
drapes
and
furnishings
were
ever-so-slightly
faded
,
as
if
they
had
seen
better
days
,
they
were
of
the
finest
silks
and
velvets
and
every
corner
was
swept
,
polished
and
cleaned
daily
so
that
no
single
speck
of
dust
,
let
alone
a
cobweb
,
dared
show
itself
.
The
showroom
was
neither
large
nor
small
,
decorated
in
muted
shades
of
aubergine
which
would
not
detract
from
the
clothes
.
There
was
a
low
table
and
three
or
four
dainty
chairs
with
aubergine
velvet
seats
and
gilded
spindle
legs
.
The
crystal
chandelier
was
for
effect
only
-
lighting
that
would
show
off
the
clothes
to
their
best
advantage
was
brilliant
yet
discreet
,
and
along
one
wall
were
racks
holding
some
of
the
ready-to-wear
garments
.
In
contrast
to
this
elegant
frontage
the
workrooms
beyond
were
a
hive
of
frenzied
activity
.
Pattern
cutters
,
fitters
,
sewing
hands
and
their
assistants
all
worked
at
an
incredible
speed
.
This
,
Paula
soon
discovered
,
was
the
way
of
the
fashion
world
-
a
constant
frantic
rush
against
the
clock
,
to
have
collections
ready
on
time
or
to
complete
individual
couture
garments
for
customers
who
always
considered
their
order
more
urgent
,
more
important
,
than
that
of
anyone
else
.
Paula
was
amazed
by
the
security
arrangements
that
were
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
new
season
's
collections
remained
exclusive
-
the
windows
at
the
rear
of
the
premises
were
heavily
barred
and
practically
the
first
thing
she
had
to
do
on
commencing
her
employment
was
to
sign
a
contract
promising
that
she
would
not
breathe
a
word
about
the
designs
she
saw
.
On
her
second
day
Madame
Mattli
took
her
to
Vidal
Sassoon
's
salon
in
Grosvenor
House
so
that
her
hair
could
be
cut
in
an
up-to-the-minute
style
.
Unlike
some
couturiers
Madame
did
not
mind
if
her
model
girls
did
not
have
the
same
colour
hair
but
she
did
insist
on
identical
styles
.
By
the
time
Vidal
Sassoon
had
finished
with
her
Paula
's
long
fair
locks
had
been
shorn
to
a
sharp
geometric
shape
and
she
scarcely
recognised
the
reflection
that
looked
back
at
her
from
the
mirror
.
Among
the
rich
and
famous
who
had
come
to
the
salon
to
have
their
hair
cut
,
tinted
and
set
,
Paula
recognised
Dusty
Springfield
,
the
pop
singer
,
her
eyes
big
and
sooty
,
her
lips
pearly
pink
,
and
was
unable
to
suppress
the
thrill
of
excitement
which
ran
through
her
.
This
was
her
very
first
taste
of
only
the
best
being
good
enough
-
and
she
liked
it
!
It
was
Paula
's
job
to
show
samples
,
parading
slowly
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
clients
as
they
sat
on
the
elegant
spindle-leg
chairs
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
garments
with
a
critical
and
practised
eye
.
Sometimes
they
came
alone
,
sometimes
with
a
man
in
tow
-
to
foot
the
bill
!
Paula
guessed
.
The
appearance
of
a
famous
face
in
the
show
rooms
always
caused
a
stir
amongst
the
girls
,
who
all
longed
to
hook
a
wealthy
husband
-
and
if
he
had
a
title
,
like
the
Aly
Khan
,
or
was
a
film
star
like
Omar
Shariff
,
then
so
much
the
better
!
Not
everything
that
Paula
had
to
do
was
quite
so
glamorous
,
however
.
In
the
long
hours
when
there
were
no
customers
to
show
she
was
expected
to
lend
a
hand
with
some
of
the
unskilled
tasks
-
running
errands
and
making
tea
,
unpicking
a
seam
or
a
hem
,
even
sewing
on
a
button
or
a
hook
and
eye
when
she
had
been
taught
the
proper
way
to
do
it
.
Paula
was
not
very
clever
with
her
needle
but
she
soon
learned
to
be
careful
so
as
not
to
incur
the
wrath
of
the
seamstress
.
There
were
new
tricks
of
modelling
to
be
learned
too
-
how
to
remove
a
coat
,
sliding
It
carefully
off
her
shoulders
with
the
sleeves
hanging
in
perfect
balance
,
never
for
one
moment
allowing
the
inside
to
be
on
view
,
for
samples
were
often
unlined
.
This
trick
took
hours
of
practice
,
up
and
down
the
landing
at
the
hostel
while
the
other
girls
looked
at
her
as
if
she
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
.
Although
she
enjoyed
her
job
Paula
was
lonely
.
Even
the
most
popular
of
girls
soon
discovered
that
in
this
highly
competitive
world
where
models
vied
with
one
another
for
the
most
glamorous
jobs
and
the
wealthiest
and
best-looking
men
there
was
far
more
bitchiness
than
in
the
provinces
-
and
Paula
was
far
from
popular
.
The
other
girls
disliked
her
for
her
outstanding
looks
and
her
haughty
ways
and
made
no
attempt
to
be
friendly
on
anything
but
the
most
superficial
level
and
the
pattern
cutters
and
sewing
hands
hurried
home
to
their
families
and
boyfriends
the
moment
they
finished
their
long
day
's
work
.
Paula
spent
most
of
her
free
time
alone
,
window
shopping
,
visiting
News
Theatres
,
where
she
sometimes
watched
the
programme
of
cartoons
twice
round
,
and
drinking
endless
cups
of
Espresso
coffee
in
cafes
and
coffee
houses
.
Her
favourite
was
the
coffee
shop
in
Fenwicks
in
Bond
Street
for
this
was
the
haunt
and
the
meeting
place
of
all
those
from
the
world
of
fashion
.
One
lunchtime
when
she
had
been
at
the
House
of
Mattli
for
a
few
months
Paula
went
there
for
her
usual
coffee
and
the
cottage
cheese
salad
that
was
her
staple
diet
now
that
it
was
so
important
that
she
did
not
add
a
single
half-inch
to
her
wand-slim
figure
.
She
took
her
tray
to
the
pay
desk
,
opened
her
bag
and
felt
for
her
purse
.
It
was
not
there
.
Frantically
she
rooted
round
,
then
checked
her
pockets
without
success
.
"
I
'm
sorry
.
I
seem
to
have
lost
my
purse
-
"
she
explained
.
The
girl
behind
the
till
stared
at
her
stonily
.
Paula
was
going
hot
and
cold
by
now
.
Had
it
been
stolen
?
No
,
she
remembered
her
bag
tipping
over
in
the
cloakroom
at
Mattli
-
it
must
have
fallen
out
then
.
But
without
it
she
could
not
pay
for
her
coffee
and
salad
.
"
Having
trouble
?
"
a
voice
beside
her
asked
.
"
Do
n't
worry
.
Let
me
.
"
Paula
turned
gratefully
,
then
gasped
with
surprise
as
she
recognised
the
slight
figure
in
black
roll-neck
sweater
and
skin
tight
pants
.
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
Gary
Oliver
!
What
are
you
doing
here
?
"
"
The
same
as
you
I
expect
,
Paula
-
getting
my
strength
up
to
face
the
rest
of
the
day
.
Let
me
pay
and
then
we
'll
have
lunch
together
and
do
some
catching
up
-
unless
you
're
meeting
someone
,
of
course
.
"
"
No
-
no
,
I
'm
not
.
"
Paula
picked
up
her
try
and
moved
aside
waiting
for
him
,
flushed
with
pleasure
at
seeing
a
familiar
face
.
Gary
Oliver
was
a
designer
,
young
and
very
talented
.
She
had
met
him
back
home
in
the
west
country
when
he
had
come
to
supervise
a
show
put
on
by
one
of
the
big
ready-to-wear
labels
,
Carnega
,
for
whom
he
worked
as
a
junior
member
of
the
design
team
.
For
a
whole
week
they
had
worked
closely
together
,
sharing
flasks
of
coffee
and
packets
of
cigarettes
and
Paula
had
grown
to
like
the
pixieish
little
man
who
by
his
very
nature
offered
her
no
challenge
-
and
no
threat
.
Gary
should
have
been
a
girl
,
she
had
thought
,
for
he
was
half
a
head
smaller
than
she
was
with
fair
curling
hair
,
baby-blue
eyes
and
long
thick
lashes
that
were
the
envy
of
every
woman
who
met
him
.
"
Shall
we
sit
over
there
in
the
corner
?
"
Gary
suggested
.
He
led
the
way
,
his
slim
hips
in
the
tight
fitting
pants
snaking
gracefully
between
the
tables
.
They
unloaded
their
trays
on
to
a
table
.
"
What
are
you
doing
in
London
then
,
Paula
?
Apart
from
mislaying
your
purse
,
I
mean
.
"
He
grinned
at
her
impishly
.
She
told
him
.
"
And
what
about
you
?
Are
n't
you
with
Carnega
any
more
?
"
He
shook
his
head
.
Dimples
played
in
his
cheeks
.
"
No
-
now
I
'm
with
the
House
of
Oliver
.
"
"
The
House
of
Oliver
-
?
Oh
!
"
she
squealed
as
light
dawned
.
"
Your
own
house
?
You
've
set
up
as
a
designer
in
your
own
right
,
Gary
!
"
"
Yep
.
In
a
small
way
at
the
moment
,
of
course
,
but
things
are
happening
.
I
came
into
a
bit
of
money
when
my
grandmother
died
and
I
decided
to
put
it
to
good
use
.
"
"
Is
n't
it
a
bit
of
a
risk
?
"
Paula
asked
.
He
shrugged
his
narrow
shoulders
.
"
Perhaps
.
But
I
wanted
to
work
for
myself
.
Designing
clothes
for
Carnega
was
all
very
well
and
I
made
a
good
living
at
it
I
wo
n't
deny
but
I
wanted
to
be
free
to
do
my
own
thing
-
and
to
have
my
own
name
on
the
labels
.
I
have
quite
a
few
contacts
-
people
who
knew
me
when
I
was
designing
for
Carnega
-
and
they
have
been
very
encouraging
.
So
I
have
decided
to
move
to
London
and
open
a
showroom
.
In
fact
I
have
just
been
looking
at
a
place
in
South
Audley
Street
,
not
far
from
Mattli
.
If
it
works
out
we
shall
practically
be
neighbours
,
Paula
.
"
"
What
a
small
world
!
I
had
no
idea
,
"
Paula
said
,
surprised

had
not
already

Usually
the
slightest
whisper
travelled
like
jungle
drums
through
the
world
of
fashion
.
Until
now
Gary
had
been
an
out-of-town
designer
,

course
.
But
if
he
was
moving
to
London
his
new
fashion
house
would
soon
be
a
talking
point

Gary

he
finished
his
cheese
roll

Paula
laughed
.
"

do
n't

They
walked
back
to
South
Audley
Street
together
,
weaving
their
way
through
the
lunchtime
crowds
on
the
pavements

the
tall
,
striking
girl
and
the
young
man
whose
pixieish
looks
belied
his
twenty-six
years
.
Outside
the
front
entrance
of
the
House

Mattli
Paula
turned
to
give
him
a
quick
impulsive
hug

She
held
up
her
fingers
,
tightly
crossed
for
him
.
He
grinned
.
"

she
called
,
and
ran
in
through
the
imposing
front
door
.
Madame
Mattli
was
furious
.
In
all
the
time
she
had
been
with
her
Paula
had
never
seen
her
so
angry
.
"

she
said
,
her
immaculately
painted
lips
tight
with
fury
.
Beside
her
Monsieur
Mattli
,
a
small
Greek-looking
man
,
some
ten
years
her
senior
,
was
also
quivering
with
indignation
.
"
Not
once

several
times

"
he
added
.
It
was
so
unusual
for
him
to
contribute
anything
to
the
conversation
that
Paula
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
.
Though
he
was
always
in
evidence
it
was
invariably
Madame
who
did
all
the
talking
,
giving
orders
,
fussing
around
clients
,
so
that
Paula
was
never
quite
certain
what
his
role
was
.
"
Gary
Oliver

a
friend

"
she
said
defensively
.
Madame
Mattli
snorted
angrily
.
"

"
"
He

a
rival

"
Paula
broke
off
.
It
seemed
ridiculous
that
a
newcomer
like
Gary
could
be
any
threat
to
a
well-established
house
like
Mattli
.
But
in
the
cut-throat
world
of
fashion
up
and
coming
designers
were
to
be
feared
-
and
already
Gary
's
reputation
was
growing
.
"
You
know
that
we
insist
on
complete
loyalty

"
Madame
Mattli
continued
.
"
The
security
of
our
designs
is
paramount
.
Oh
Paula
,
how
could
you
!
"
"
But
I

never
mention
anything

"
Paula
protested
.
Madame
snorted
again
.
"
How
can
I
be
sure
of
that
?
Even
if
you
do
not
intend
to
be
disloyal
there
is
always
the
risk
that
you
might
be
careless
.
Pillow
talk
is
the
most
dangerous
.
"
"
Pillow
talk

Paula
repeated
,
stunned
.
Close
though
her
friendship
with
Gary
had
become
she
had
never
once
breathed
a
word
to
him
about
the
new
collections
she
saw
taking
shape
at
Mattli
-
and
as
for
"
pillow
talk
"
the
notion
was
absurd
.
There
was
nothing
like
that
between
them
and
never
would
be
.
Gary
was
not
interested
in
girls
.
Surely
that
must
be
obvious
to
everyone
who
met
him
.
"
You
must
stop
visiting
him
,
"
Madame
said
firmly
.
"
Either
I
have
your
word
on
It

I
am
afraid

no

in
my
employ

Gary
Oliver
again
.
"
Paula
was
trembling
.
Her
job
with
the
House
of
Mattli
was
her
life
.
But
to
allow
herself
to
be
dictated
to
in
this
way
when
she
knew
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
was
tantamount
to
admitting
guilt
.
And
she
could
n't
bear
the
thought
of
being
sucked
back
into
the
ebb
tide
of
loneliness
again
either
.
With
Gary
she
enjoyed
a
relationship
she
had
never
experienced
with
anyone
else
-
the
easy-going
friendship
of
a
male
who
made
no
demands
whatever
on
her
-
and
it
meant
more
to
her
than
she
had
realised
.
"
I
have
never
betrayed
any
confidence

I
never
will

said

was
a
hint
of
sadness
now
in
Madame

eyes
but
her
mouth
was
set
and
determined

"
Paula
was
still
afraid
of
Madame
Mattli
-
and
she
was
also
close
to
tears
.
But
she
was
determined
Madame
should
not
be
aware
of
either
.
"
Yes

The
showrooms
of
the
House
of
Oliver
were
smaller
and
less
grand
than
those
at
the
House
of
Mattli
but
the
decor
was
newer
and
fresher
,
pale
grey
drapes
,
ultra
modern
black
furniture
and
a
great
deal
of
gleaming
stainless
steel
.
Gary
was
in
the
workroom
when
Paula
arrived
,
pinning
a
length
of
vibrant
pink
chiffon
sarong-style
around
one
of
his
models
.
His
mouth
was
full
of
pins
.
"

asked
without
moving
his
lips

perched
herself
against
the
cutting
table
trying
to
look
nonchalant
.
"

she
said
.
Gary
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
,
pins
spewing
from
his
mouth
and
catching
on
the
front
of
his
black
jersey
.
Then
he
unpinned
the
length
of
chiffon
and
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
.
The
model
stood
motionless
,
clad
in
nothing
but
her
bra
and
stockings
,
waiting
for
his
instructions
.
"
We
'll

pulled
on
her
wrap

moved
to
the
door
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
as
she
went

aware

the
hostility
in

gaze

Paula
smiled
.
For
the
first
time
she
felt
the
stirrings
of
something
like
power
.
It
was
not
unlike
the
feeling
she
experienced
when
men
looked
at
her
and
wanted
her
though
she
knew
it
could
not
be
that
for
there
was
nothing
sexual
between
her
and
Gary
and
never
would
be
.
But
it
was
just
as
exciting
,
nevertheless
.
It
made
her
feel
strong
,
invincible
almost
,
and
just
a
tiny
bit
as
if
she
had
drunk
too
much
wine
.
Her
smile
spread
.
